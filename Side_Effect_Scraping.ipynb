      "[['I have suffered with urine infections on and off for years and was always given Macrobid or trimethoprim which never cleared it up for long or completely, and also gave me severe side effects. A new doctor started me on Keflex and it has cleared it up properly - very minimal side effects if any.'], ['I started with a bladder infection on Sunday. I was urinating every 10-15 minutes, and it was so painful and I felt a lot of pressure. I called the doctor, and I was put on Bactrim on Monday night. The Bactrim gave me the spins, constipation, and anxiety. It was a nightmare! After 5 doses of Bactrim, my infection kept getting worse. I called the doctor, and they switched me to Keflex. I started the Keflex at 9 pm, and in less than 24 hours, I felt much better. No side effects except a little bit of nausea and dizziness, so remember to eat when you take it. It is a miracle drug for urinary infections and bladder infections.'], ['I was prescribed Keflex (Cephalexin) after having surgery to prevent infection, and wanted to add to the list of side effects. They do not mention acid reflux, which I had every time I took the capsule (4 times a day, for 10 days). Also women need to take a probiotic while on this medication as it decreases natural flora and you can get a yeast infection. I learned this the hard way by not eating enough yogurt while on this medication and not taking any probiotics. Just wanted to give a heads up and hopefully spare many women this highly uncomfortable experience.'], [\"I have a double whammy: I have interstitial cystitis (which feels like a constant bladder infection), and on top of that I'm prone to actual bladder infections. I've learned to be able to tell the difference between a bladder infection and a cystitis flare-up. I have a lot of drug allergies and cannot take sulfa drugs or Cipro, which are commonly prescribed for bladder infections. Keflex has been the only antibiotic that I can take that doesn't give me any side effects and gets rid of the infection. It's saved my bacon on numerous occasions. I also prophylactically take Acidophilus orally to avoid yeast infections. It all works like a charm. I have NEVER had a bad side effect from Keflex.\"], [\"I had recurring boils in one area. They would show up randomly so the dr. was never able to take a culture since they would come to a head and then pop whenever. He put me on a 20-day regimen of Keflex (500) and another ointment antibiotic that he told me to dab into my nose. He said for some odd reason, boils seem to start in the nose. I followed the instructions and had a minor recurrence several months later. I went immediately to see him so he put me back on Keflex. These boils were clustered and leaving scars in the area. They haven't recurred and the scars are gone. Since I caught them starting the 2nd time, they never had a chance to come to a head because I stayed on top of it. I highly recommend it for a skin bacterial infection.\"], [\"So I ended a Saturday at the ER. I ended up having a urinary infection, a severe one. The PA prescribed Keflex 500 mg for 7 days - it really helped after 2 days, but I noticed that it does bring out side effects on myself. I feel nauseous, tired, agitated, eyes feel hot, headaches. Even though I took 2 Advil, it was still there. I also feel super anxious, I've been having mood swings, I feel more sad, and somehow more depressed than I have been in the past. And I still have one more day to go.\"], ['I was prescribed Keflex twice a day for 7 days for UTI but I only lasted 4 days. Before I took this medication I had some anxiety, but no other mental health issues besides my ADHD. The 2nd day I took it I became psychotic. I was severely depressed, paranoid, convinced everyone was talking about me or working against me. I cried all day. My mind was racing & convincing me of all kinds of delusions about myself & those around me. I was having vivid disturbing nightmares. I couldn’t eat anything.

We added group ADHD therapy for him at a local clinic with other boys his age, which also helped hugely. My suggestion to parents is, please do not just rely on a medicine.

The first day I took it right before bed and woke up feeling lethargic. But every day since got progressively better. I was more calm, experienced less anxiety and mood swings, was able to focus and handle stresses more easily, and because I wasn't so anxious or emotional I wasn't overeating.

He would fall asleep on his desk after lunch, in the car or on the couch after school, and just completely lost his personality. He was calm and could focus better, but he never laughed, was never silly, barely played; it was awful. We tried going back to 1 mg but had more trouble focusing again, so we tried 1mg in the morning and 1 in the evening. But he was still a little zombie. So we gave up.

I highly recommend this medication to my fellow autism ADHD mama who never get to sleep and are stretched too thin and have trouble with getting their child to relax and focus.

      "[['I have been on this medication for about 6 months that I can recall for my anxiety and ADD. The first few times I took it at night, but I could not fall asleep as the doctor told me I would. Now, I normally take it around 1 to 3 pm in the evening, and I get very productive. I love this medication for this. I have depression, anxiety, and ADD, and it helps a lot with the ADD. I even notice at work I become way more focused and awake, ready to do work. This medication has also helped me a lot in school as I would be quieter in class and listen more. I do see that my emotions are calmed down as well. I would say this is the best medication I have ever had in my life, and I believe so. It has truly changed my life for the better. I have also been on many stimulants, and my emotions were all over the place on those. This is an amazing medication. I take 1 mg as well.'], [\"This drug has made me feel whole and complete for the first time in my life. I'm so grateful. It fixed massive problems with RSD and social anxiety and even TMJ. I have been weeping because I am feeling normal for the first time in my life. I am a 31-year-old female and take this alongside Vyvanse 2x a day at 1 mg doses.\"], [\"My 7-year-old was diagnosed with ADHD, and we tried Adderall and other medicines, and the results were nil, and the side effects were awful. We then tried Intuniv at 1mg, and the results were amazing. My hyper-impulsive little guy was doing well in school, and his temper was subdued. We added group ADHD therapy for him at a local clinic with other boys his age, which also helped hugely. My suggestion to parents is, please do not just rely on a medicine. Find a good counselor that will help you and your child by giving you tools to use in everyday life, like learning to patiently wait, be a gracious loser, etc. As far as the Intuniv goes... My son will be 9 in a few months, and we are still only on 1mg. Don't rush to 2mgs without giving 1mg a chance.\"], [\"I am 39 and have dealt with my ADD for all my life. May of 2012, the Dr. started me out on 1 mg. After a week, I could tell a difference. Like a filing cabinet in my brain. However, I was VERY tired. So I decided to take it at night. (I've always had a hard time shutting my brain off to sleep). Next week she upped me to 2 mg. After a few days, I started to notice I focus more...GREAT!! and I was sleeping better!! She then put me on 3 mg. I couldn't tolerate it! I started getting hot flashes and thought I was going to pass out! I couldn't sit out in the sun, I had to stay in. So she lowered me back to 2 mg. A year later and it's the best decision I have ever made. My brain is calm, I am focused and sleep like a bear!\"], [\"I have a 9-year-old HF autistic child that is mixed with some ADD and ODD. He used to have huge meltdowns at school to the point where he was harming himself and whoever was in the way. He would go from hot to cold in seconds; we believed it was a mood disorder. They tried to prescribe Risperidone at first, but I refused because of all the research I did on it. Once the doctor gave me Intuniv, all the meltdowns literally stopped! In May, it will be a year he has been on it. I give him 2mg every night because when I gave it in the morning, he was falling asleep in class. If he misses 1 dose, it throws him off completely. If he doesn't eat enough on it, he does get nauseous with headaches, but it's only on those random days he doesn't feel like eating anything, especially at school. So, I always try to remind him that eating and drinking water are a must! That is my only downside about it, those random times he does get sick.\"], [\"My son has ADHD and is taking Intuniv 3 mg. I find with this drug, he is so sleepy; all he wants to do is sleep. It's supposed to help his concentration, but it doesn't. He's too tired. It also makes him angry, and he's in a bad mood all the time. I stopped giving it to him for a few days to see if it would make a difference in his mood, and it did - he was so much happier. I don't know what to do, whether to keep him on it or stop it. The doctor is adamant that it's not the drug, it's behavior, but I know it is the drug. Anyone else have this problem...\"], ['I must say, I have been through a lot of medicines. Wasted money, but most of all, watching my kid struggle with his high anxiety and his inability to focus or sit down. He now focuses better in school, and his teacher describes him as on task now and takes time to ask her questions if needed. I had a lot of nights crying, thinking I was a bad mother! I would lose control and not be able to handle his constant stubbornness and defiance. He is a beautiful, energetic boy with an amazing personality, but just needed to be taken down a few notches. This has done the trick. I started off on 1 mg and did not seem to do too much, and after three months decided to move to 2. I tried all-natural, but nothing worked. Good luck.'], [\"My 8-year-old son was extremely hyperactive and had anger issues. Even though he was on Adderall, he was constantly biting his brother and sister, arguing with his dad and me, kicking, throwing tantrums, and acting like a baby when he didn't get his way. After we added Intuniv to his daily dose of Adderall, he is a completely different child. It has been wonderful. There has been less yelling and arguing, less fighting; he actually gets along and plays with his brother and sister and us. I love this medicine! I only wish we found it sooner. Thank you for giving us our son back!\"], ['I’m (female) rapid cycling bipolar 2 and ADHD and PMDD. My doctor did a genetic test and found that I have a defect in the adrenaline pathway. My dopamine pathway is ok, which means Adderall and co wouldn’t work for me. Hence, she prescribed me this drug since it works on adrenaline regulation. I’m 37 and 65 kilos. On 1mg, I already felt a massive difference and on 2mg, I’m even better. Less depression, less anxiety, less irritability, almost no food cravings only real hunger, less heart racing, less urge to move. I have no dry mouth, no sleepiness, no abdominal pain, etc. The only negative side effect I feel is maybe a 30 percent decreased libido and it takes me longer to reach orgasm. I strongly believe that this drug works for me so well given I actually need it, i.e., I HAVE that genetic defect. So please, everybody, have your tests done.'], ['This is a great medicine. I have known that my daughter, now 7, has always been extremely energetic and talkative her entire life, but her impulsivity, inability to concentrate on work (or play), and energy were really interfering with her school and home life. I was so stressed out every day. The behavioral problems were never-ending. I mean this child was ALWAYS in trouble, poor girl! She is now like the little girl that I always knew was hiding away in there, but would only rarely come out. She has all of the same positive personality traits plus more. I feel like I can finally connect with her, like her brain just clicked and she is now living in the same reality as everyone around her instead of lost in her mind. It does make her sleepy.'], ['So far so good. My 14-year-old just started this drug. He’s ADD and has had major setbacks in life because of it. Stimulants helped; however, this drug has made him able to verbalize thoughts, think clearly, remember (most noticeable), engage with friends and make friends, be much more organized, plan things, be attentive in a calmer way, recognize when he needs the bathroom, communicate feeling and sensation in his body, the list goes on. Wish we’d known about this drug (and doctor) 7-8 years ago.'], ['3 full days on 1 mg of Guanfacine for adult ADHD and I am very happy with the results. I cannot take stimulants as they make my heart race, make my anxiety worse, and cause a host of other side effects. I do not feel sleepy, sluggish, or hungover on this medicine. I take it at bedtime and wake up rested, ready for the day. No crash at the end of the day either. I am a 38-year-old female with mainly inattentive ADHD, diagnosed as an adult. Leaving this review because I didn’t see a ton of positive reviews for adults taking this medicine for ADHD. It provides me with enough calm focus to make my life way easier than no medicine. Only noted side effect is dry mouth. Definitely not a big deal. I recommend trying this.'], [\"27 years old and just recently got ADHD diagnosis. Improvements listed in order where each subsequent improvement may have a dependency to previous ones. Objective improvements (no way I imagine this): - SLEEP (!!!) - Almost no 'Sympathetic rush' (this is something that happens to me based on bothersome thoughts, irritations, or getting startled -- it's like hyperarousal from PTSD but based on emotions and not memories) - Significant improvement in anxiety - Significant improvement in social anxiety - Significant improvement in cardiovascular health - Significant improvement in social avoidance - Significant improvement in confidence - Dark circles around my eyes reduced by 50% - Less easy to be woken up from sleep - Noticeable PVC and PAC arrhythmia wholly disappeared - Can now tolerate stimulants Subjective: - My emotions are more contextual / based on where I'm in life NOW and not from where my thoughts are. - My mental ability is much 'clearer'.\"], [\"My son has been taking Intuniv for 3 years now and has shown major improvements. The prior medications were causing my son to have tics and violent outbursts. This medication helps him more with concentration and focus, but when that is under control, I notice the hyperactivity is more tolerable. My son's grades improved drastically, and I no longer receive phone calls from his school and teachers (this was a weekly if not daily occurrence).\"], [\"My son is 8 and was diagnosed with ADHD recently. This is the first medication he has taken. We started at 1mg, working our way up to 3mg, and it's taken in the evening around 5pm. Once at 3mg, my son was extremely sleepy, even falling asleep in class and on the bus ride home. He was emotional about everything, even looking for toys, he would cry. He also experienced terrible tummy aches. He became very irritable; I'm guessing because he was sleepy. I had his doctor lower the dosage to 2mg, and he is becoming that little guy I know again! He's still kind of sleepy but not as bad, and his teacher is noticing a big improvement in his focus at school. We are still working out the kinks, but I am hopeful! Best of luck to you all!\"], [\"My 11-year-old son has ADHD with an anxiety disorder. This medication has helped him manage his anxiety (he is much happier) and he is able to focus better on managing everything from time to his emotions. He has better stamina mentally and can perform mental tasks for longer periods of time. He is also acting more mature and being more responsible. He takes 2mg at night 1 hour before bed along with gummy melatonin to help him sleep. He sleeps well and feels good during the day. Overall, this medication has helped him a great deal. It's like it took him out of his anxious rut and gives him a better outlook.\"], [\"My son is almost six years old and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. He was evaluated due to the fact that he was always in trouble in school, home, and getting kicked off of the bus. He also seemed to struggle with focusing on us when we talked. His doctor had us try Intuniv... we started at 1 mg every morning. The positive change was very noticeable. He was calmer, had a less aggressive attitude, and even used his indoor voice. It did make him sleepier but that only lasted for the first two days. He is on his third day of 2 mg and is doing well. For the past few weeks, he hasn't been getting into trouble at school and his bus driver said he is doing amazing. He also seems to be focusing better.\"], [\"I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and ADHD. Stimulant control of ADHD was out of the question because it would exacerbate Bipolar 2. My doc started me tentatively on Intuniv and told me I may be groggy at first, but over time it could help me feel more calm and focused. She was right. The first day I took it right before bed and woke up feeling lethargic. But every day since got progressively better. I was more calm, experienced less anxiety and mood swings, was able to focus and handle stresses more easily, and because I wasn't so anxious or emotional I wasn't overeating. My weight leveled out, I was sleeping through the night and quit getting insomnia, I was able to sit still through classes without fidgeting and really concentrate.\"], [\"The first few days on 1 mg in the morning, he was so tired in the afternoon, but by the 5th day he was doing better. At 2 mg, it started over but never faded. After 3 weeks, the Dr. suggested taking it at night, but it was no better. He would fall asleep on his desk after lunch, in the car or on the couch after school, and just completely lost his personality. He was calm and could focus better, but he never laughed, was never silly, barely played; it was awful. We tried going back to 1 mg but had more trouble focusing again, so we tried 1mg in the morning and 1 in the evening. But he was still a little zombie. So we gave up. I'd rather have him bouncing off the walls than too tired to laugh and play.\"], [\"I would like to say that my son is 10 years old and is a non to limited verbal level 3 autistic child. We have tried everything and I feel as though this medicine has brought my little boy back. He is no longer experiencing insomnia the way he used to, he's so much happier, he is trying to communicate more, he is working well with others, he smiles and laughs like he used to. I could not be more pleased with what this medicine has done and he has not been on it for even the full week. I highly recommend this medication to my fellow autism ADHD mama who never get to sleep and are stretched too thin and have trouble with getting their child to relax and focus. This is not a stimulant medication. This is not an addictive medication; this is a godsend and I think whoever made this medication, it is definitely the best possible medication for an autistic child. I couldn't rate it higher than 10, and if I could, it would be an 11.\"], ['The brand version of Intuniv has been extremely helpful for my son with helping him to moderate his ADHD behaviors. He was diagnosed with the hyperactive subtype, and the problematic behaviors all but disappeared while taking a daily 2mg dose. He has been taking Intuniv for over 4 years now with no observed side-effects.'], [\"I'm an 18-year-old male. I've been taking ADHD medications since I was 7 years old. The big problem I had with them is anxiety. I was taking 80mg Vyvanse previously and was able to drop it to 60mg with 1mg Intuniv. This worked great and helped solve some of my anxiety. Since my workload has increased dramatically, I had to once more increase my doses slightly. It's my first day on 70mg of Vyvanse and 2mg Intuniv. Honestly, this medication is very good. As a little bonus, I find it really helps control and notice one's own impulsive behaviors. Overall, very good. I'll keep you posted on how the 2mg on Intuniv works. (I'm 155 lbs, 5'10. Started Intuniv 5 months ago.)\"], [\"My son was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago, and like most parents, I refused to believe that anything was 'wrong' with my son. After research, I decided against medication because of the TERRIBLE reviews and side effects... until I heard about Intuniv. It has been one of the BEST decisions that I have ever made. He still has his happy little personality and is still a rambunctious little boy, but he is able to sit in class without bouncing off the walls, and his grades have really improved. Like previous reviews, he was very tired and had headaches in the beginning, but as the Dr promised, that quickly faded. He is 8 now and will remind me if I forget to give it to him because he says that it makes him feel better, and he sleeps like a log.\"], ['This drug is awful. It doesn’t help ADHD at all ok. It sedates you and turns off your inhibitions which makes you less impulsive. But that’s not helping ADHD at all. Same goes for autism and anxiety. You can argue that it helps certain things but for a drug to work you need to stay functional and not completely shut off and brain dead. I could not function normally while on this. I was a zombie all day. Side affects were light headiness, loss appetite, sleeping a lot, pins, nausea, and bodily dissociation.'], [\"This medicine was magical!

Not to the pill itself, but to your own person and finally start living and not just surviving. It's not such a big deal, I promise. Diabetics get insulin from other sources outside the body, it is kinda the same for you, you just need a little more of your serotonin and voilà. My only regret is having wasted and missed so many things because of my pride against antidepressants and self-pity attitude. Hang in there, you got this.

      "For Depression \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I am 34 and I have experienced severe anxiety and depression since I was about 12 years old. I started off with Prozac 10mg for the first 6 weeks and then went up to 20mg. I've been on it for a little over 2 months now and I feel amazing. I'm sleeping better, not emotional eating. I'm happier, I haven't cried except tears of joy because of how ALIVE I finally feel again. I feel like for the longest time I've been in this dark hole just seeing the sun occasionally but now I can feel the warmth of the sun kissing my skin. I smile when I see the sun. I smile when I feel the rain or a breeze. The little things that matter most. I feel everything again. I'm also doing things I used to love, that I eventually stopped doing when I was in my dark place. My kids are happy to have their mom back! I highly recommend this. Prozac saved my life.\"\n",

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I was encouraged by my psychiatrist to try Prozac for the first time, 20 mg a day. I spent many, many years always worried about other people's feelings to the point of overthinking things constantly. Worrying what people thought of me and I had low self-esteem and low self-opinion. Social anxiety was always a serious problem for me also. With that being said, anxiety and worry crept into full-blown depression. So my doctor put me on Prozac 20 mg. At first, it made me a little drowsy, but it gave me a way better feeling of calmness, peace, and basically not worried at all about little things or what people thought of me. And after about a month, all of those chronic worry, stress, and fears were totally gone. Totally. In my own personal experience, Prozac allowed me to tackle the important things of life and not worry or even think of petty things and other people's behavior. It basically gets rid of toxic stress and worry. And makes you mentally 'strong' if that makes sense.\"\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\n",
      "For Obsessive Compulsive Disorder \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I don’t find a lot of positive stories about antidepressants, or I find stories where people are taking the antidepressant the wrong way. I wanted to share my experience. A positive one. I’ve had generalized anxiety disorder, SEVERE OCD, and panic disorder for as long as I can remember. My first memory of having an episode was when I was 4 years old at my kindergarten interview. I feel as though I was born with the illnesses mentioned above, right from the womb. When I was a child I was extremely anxious, had bad separation anxiety from my parents, and had extreme OCD. I was just a kid and thought that the way I was feeling is how all kids felt, I didn’t realize that I was different. This went on, and got even worse in middle school. I began developing trichotillomania in middle school. In high school, I went from being a 90% above student to failing every class within a couple of years. I couldn’t leave the house. My panic disorder and GAD caused debilitating physical symptoms. I would be shaking when I had to leave the house, I wouldn’t drink alcohol because I was afraid of vomiting, I was suffering so much, for my whole entire life with severe phobias, fears, and anxiety. I prayed and prayed and prayed to God every night for it to go away. I was a 16-year-old living in a prison of her own mind. It never went away. Every single day was the worst day of my life, I would wake up and the thoughts just started, I never had a break. My life was exhausting. I am of East Indian background, and my parents didn’t understand mental illness well. It is very taboo in my culture. I went to tons of doctors, and they told me it was just growing pains, no doctor ever told me that maybe I should see a therapist. I didn’t have any support. When I was 22, I attempted suicide. Luckily, the attempt didn’t work, and I was forced to go on medication. I was livid, I was so against antidepressants, I was so, so, so scared, it felt unnatural. My general practitioner put me on Effexor. I took it for almost 8 weeks, it helped me to not want to kill myself, but it also made me gain tons of weight which made me depressed, and it made me hear voices. One evening a voice told me to choke my mom, and I started freaking out, and my parents drove me immediately to the hospital. At the hospital, I talked to a psych nurse who calmed me down, and got me an appointment with a psychiatrist the next day. This appointment and this psychiatrist saved my life, and changed my entire life. I want to really mention that you should not be going to a General Practitioner for mental illness medication, you should ALWAYS, ALWAYS go to a psychiatrist no matter what. If your GP is the only person you are seeing to help you manage your meds for OCD, anxiety, etc, that is the WRONG MOVE. That is such a common mistake people are making, you NEED a psychiatrist in order to get the meds right, please do not just go to your regular doctor, you’ll be cheating yourself. I went to the psychiatrist appointment the next day. It was the first time I had ever seen a psychiatrist. I got into her room, and we talked about everything: my childhood, my phobias, my OCD. She then brought my parents into the room to explain the whole situation to them and the fact that I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and that I have been suffering for way too long. My parents were so supportive. The doctor told me I was on the wrong medication, that I never should have been placed on Effexor which is an SNRI, and that I should be on an SSRI considering my main problem is OCD and GAD. We talked a lot about it, and she told me she would like to place me on Prozac. She said for me, because my neural pathways have been the same for 20 plus years, that I would need a higher dosage of Prozac especially for anxiety and OCD. I see on this forum, that so many people are on 20mg, or 40mg for anxiety disorders. You should be on 60mg at least, do not be afraid to go higher. People that say Prozac or an SSRI didn’t really do anything for their anxiety or OCD is because they are only taking a 20mg dose, That is not an OCD dose. 40-80mg for anxiety and OCD. Please up your dose. Use the medication, REALLY USE IT. Do not be afraid! My doctor started me on 40mg, eventually took me to 100mg, and then I went back to 80mg. Yes, the side effects are insane, I was nauseated, I couldn’t sleep, I was shaking, I had anxiety, but she prescribed me Ativan and said to use it until the Prozac kicked in. That the Ativan would keep me comfortable until that happened. Don’t try to be a hero, use your Ativan or your Xanax or whatever to stay as comfortable as possible. I could write so much more, but I’ll conclude with this. 4 months after being on 80mg of Prozac every day, I woke up one day and I was cured. Yes, cured. I had no OCD, I had no anxiety, I no longer had fears or phobias. I was cured. You have no idea how that day felt. It was like the first day of my whole entire life. I woke up being the real me, who is free-spirited and isn’t afraid of anything! I was finally free, I was no longer a prisoner. I didn’t even have to go to therapy. I just woke up one day a brand new person, from taking a high dose of Prozac every single day. DO NOT go off of the antidepressants. Your OCD, your anxiety, depression etc will come back. I WOULD never dream or even think to come off of my antidepressants, I have an illness, that will return if I go off the medication, because I have a brain disorder. OCD is a brain disorder. Do not stop taking medication for your brain disorder, do not try to fix your brain disorder with just a 20mg or 40mg dose. Own your medication, be on it for life. It’s been 5 years since I have been cured. If it wasn’t for Prozac, I would be dead. 1) You need a psychiatrist 2) Do not be afraid to take more than 40mg of Prozac to treat panic attacks etc, I am on 80mg a day and my life is a ball. It is so wonderful and so carefree. 3) Do not stop the meds. Be on the meds for life.\"\n",

I’ve been taking this medication for less than a month, but I already feel so much better. I would spend about 2-3 nights a week crying from worry and stress. I also suffer from PMDD, and a week before my periods, I would become extremely depressed. Since I started taking Prozac, I haven’t had any crying spells. I'm much calmer now, able to think clearly about things instead of getting overwhelmed with stress. I also feel way more motivated in my daily life and actually look forward to the future instead of being scared of it. The only side effects I experienced were a little bit of nausea and feeling tired (this lasted the first two weeks, but it’s gone now.) Everyone reacts differently to medication, so don’t let the bad reviews scare you!\"\n",

We have increased the dose to 40mg (2 tablets a day). It has been 2 weeks now, and I must say I feel such a change. I am able to think again, I go to bed smiling, and did not spend a single day in bed. I feel more comfortable doing the house chores, it doesn't seem impossible anymore. Not sure if it works for everyone, but it's worth the wait. Seems like the 20mg just wasn't enough for me, 40mg changed my life so far. I PRAY TO GOD IT WILL STAY LIKE THIS. If it does, I know I will be getting my life back. Ps. I was diagnosed with severe depression and post-traumatic disorder/amnesia.\"\n",

I feel like I’m a nicer person, and I feel like I can listen to other people again without my thoughts taking over. On day 14 of 20mg and staying on this dose at the moment.

I used to use food as a way to cope with my emotions. Now that is not the case, I eat normally and anxiety does not plague my life. No more obsessive thinking over small things.

I was already at an unbearable level with my anxiety & the Prozac did increase it for me for around 2 weeks. After around 3 weeks I started to feel good. I can drive again, I’m starting to enjoy being outside & doing things. I’m a lot happier, settled & at least 80% less anxious. I still have moments & I’m definitely not cured but I’m managing. Side effects for me are vivid dreams, loss of appetite & some weight loss. In the beginning, side effects were insomnia, increased anxiety, intrusive thoughts & agoraphobia. I got through it & it was like the sun finally came out once they started working. I spent hours researching & reading reviews, scaring myself silly. If you’re doing that also, I can’t say what it will do for you as everyone is different but for me, it has improved my life. If I can get through those 1st tough 2 weeks, anyone can.\"\n",

I finally got off of that and tried Prozac because I’ve always dealt with OCD and Intrusive thoughts. I cannot express how true every review is about the first couple of weeks, 3-4 weeks and you won’t feel anything really. To be honest, my anxiety was a little stronger, but trust me when I tell you it is all well worth it. I honestly feel amazing now. I can just think better and more clearly, and now I understand my intrusive thoughts are only thoughts, they aren’t my actions. Man, I used to fight with my thoughts all the time and ask why did I think that, why did I think this. Now, I understand so much more about myself and who I am and who I want to be. I was running out of hope because I just couldn’t shake my OCD tendencies and intrusive thoughts, but just give the medication time to work, your body is adjusting to it.\"\n",

I put off taking this medication for far too long, and finally caved in to taking it when my anxiety started causing me to fall into depression. I was too afraid to even go to sleep by myself before taking this, and within my first dose (only 10mg), I slept through the night all by myself. Every day I have continued to feel a bit better. 1st month I started taking 10mg, and by month 2, I am now on 20mg. Before taking this, I was suffering with panic attacks multiple times a week, and now haven’t had one since I started. The power of medication is truly amazing.

I look back now and see that suffered from anxiety for so much longer than needed to, I couldn't be more happier to have taken that chance and I want to encourage you not to be afraid because the pros beat the cons. Also before Prozac, I had EXTREMELY bad stomach issues, and taking Prozac has dramatically helped my pain. Also my dreams are CRAZY. They are always nightmares and often wake me, sweating.

I slowly had happier thoughts. After a month, my dosage was increased to 20 mg and the first week of that, I actually started feeling a little depressed again, but after a week and a half, my mood elevated. I started getting involved in activities again. I started hanging out with my family and friends again. I make an effort to do my hair and makeup, work out, work on goals... I'm back to me.

I would cry so much from becoming overly stressed. Now, I feel a significant change. I am much more calm in stressful situations. I also don't cry or get angry easily. I'm young, so my parents let me decide if I wanted to try the medication. I was worried about all the side effects, but after some overthinking, I decided to try it out.

I spent many, many years always worried about other people's feelings to the point of overthinking things constantly. Worrying what people thought of me and I had low self-esteem and low self-opinion. Social anxiety was always a serious problem for me also. With that being said, anxiety and worry crept into full-blown depression. So my doctor put me on Prozac 20 mg. At first, it made me a little drowsy, but it gave me a way better feeling of calmness, peace, and basically not worried at all about little things or what people thought of me. And after about a month, all of those chronic worry, stress, and fears were totally gone. Totally. In my own personal experience, Prozac allowed me to tackle the important things of life and not worry or even think of petty things and other people's behavior. It basically gets rid of toxic stress and worry. And makes you mentally 'strong' if that makes sense.\"\n",

      "For Obsessive Compulsive Disorder \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I don’t find a lot of positive stories about antidepressants, or I find stories where people are taking the antidepressant the wrong way. I wanted to share my experience. A positive one. I’ve had generalized anxiety disorder, SEVERE OCD, and panic disorder for as long as I can remember. My first memory of having an episode was when I was 4 years old at my kindergarten interview. I feel as though I was born with the illnesses mentioned above, right from the womb. When I was a child I was extremely anxious, had bad separation anxiety from my parents, and had extreme OCD. I was just a kid and thought that the way I was feeling is how all kids felt, I didn’t realize that I was different. This went on, and got even worse in middle school. I began developing trichotillomania in middle school. In high school, I went from being a 90% above student to failing every class within a couple of years. I couldn’t leave the house. My panic disorder and GAD caused debilitating physical symptoms. I would be shaking when I had to leave the house, I wouldn’t drink alcohol because I was afraid of vomiting, I was suffering so much, for my whole entire life with severe phobias, fears, and anxiety. I prayed and prayed and prayed to God every night for it to go away. I was a 16-year-old living in a prison of her own mind. It never went away. Every single day was the worst day of my life, I would wake up and the thoughts just started, I never had a break. My life was exhausting. I am of East Indian background, and my parents didn’t understand mental illness well. It is very taboo in my culture. I went to tons of doctors, and they told me it was just growing pains, no doctor ever told me that maybe I should see a therapist. I didn’t have any support. When I was 22, I attempted suicide. Luckily, the attempt didn’t work, and I was forced to go on medication. I was livid, I was so against antidepressants, I was so, so, so scared, it felt unnatural. My general practitioner put me on Effexor. I took it for almost 8 weeks, it helped me to not want to kill myself, but it also made me gain tons of weight which made me depressed, and it made me hear voices. One evening a voice told me to choke my mom, and I started freaking out, and my parents drove me immediately to the hospital. At the hospital, I talked to a psych nurse who calmed me down, and got me an appointment with a psychiatrist the next day. This appointment and this psychiatrist saved my life, and changed my entire life. I want to really mention that you should not be going to a General Practitioner for mental illness medication, you should ALWAYS, ALWAYS go to a psychiatrist no matter what. If your GP is the only person you are seeing to help you manage your meds for OCD, anxiety, etc, that is the WRONG MOVE. That is such a common mistake people are making, you NEED a psychiatrist in order to get the meds right, please do not just go to your regular doctor, you’ll be cheating yourself. I went to the psychiatrist appointment the next day. It was the first time I had ever seen a psychiatrist. I got into her room, and we talked about everything: my childhood, my phobias, my OCD. She then brought my parents into the room to explain the whole situation to them and the fact that I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and that I have been suffering for way too long. My parents were so supportive. The doctor told me I was on the wrong medication, that I never should have been placed on Effexor which is an SNRI, and that I should be on an SSRI considering my main problem is OCD and GAD. We talked a lot about it, and she told me she would like to place me on Prozac. She said for me, because my neural pathways have been the same for 20 plus years, that I would need a higher dosage of Prozac especially for anxiety and OCD. I see on this forum, that so many people are on 20mg, or 40mg for anxiety disorders. You should be on 60mg at least, do not be afraid to go higher. People that say Prozac or an SSRI didn’t really do anything for their anxiety or OCD is because they are only taking a 20mg dose, That is not an OCD dose. 40-80mg for anxiety and OCD. Please up your dose. Use the medication, REALLY USE IT. Do not be afraid! My doctor started me on 40mg, eventually took me to 100mg, and then I went back to 80mg. Yes, the side effects are insane, I was nauseated, I couldn’t sleep, I was shaking, I had anxiety, but she prescribed me Ativan and said to use it until the Prozac kicked in. That the Ativan would keep me comfortable until that happened. Don’t try to be a hero, use your Ativan or your Xanax or whatever to stay as comfortable as possible. I could write so much more, but I’ll conclude with this. 4 months after being on 80mg of Prozac every day, I woke up one day and I was cured. Yes, cured. I had no OCD, I had no anxiety, I no longer had fears or phobias. I was cured. You have no idea how that day felt. It was like the first day of my whole entire life. I woke up being the real me, who is free-spirited and isn’t afraid of anything! I was finally free, I was no longer a prisoner. I didn’t even have to go to therapy. I just woke up one day a brand new person, from taking a high dose of Prozac every single day. DO NOT go off of the antidepressants. Your OCD, your anxiety, depression etc will come back. I WOULD never dream or even think to come off of my antidepressants, I have an illness, that will return if I go off the medication, because I have a brain disorder. OCD is a brain disorder. Do not stop taking medication for your brain disorder, do not try to fix your brain disorder with just a 20mg or 40mg dose. Own your medication, be on it for life. It’s been 5 years since I have been cured. If it wasn’t for Prozac, I would be dead. 1) You need a psychiatrist 2) Do not be afraid to take more than 40mg of Prozac to treat panic attacks etc, I am on 80mg a day and my life is a ball. It is so wonderful and so carefree. 3) Do not stop the meds. Be on the meds for life.\"\n",

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Hello! I was prescribed Prozac for anxiety and depression. I started the first week only taking 10 mg and moved to 20 mg in week two. I’ve been taking this medication for less than a month, but I already feel so much better. I would spend about 2-3 nights a week crying from worry and stress. I also suffer from PMDD, and a week before my periods, I would become extremely depressed. Since I started taking Prozac, I haven’t had any crying spells. I'm much calmer now, able to think clearly about things instead of getting overwhelmed with stress. I also feel way more motivated in my daily life and actually look forward to the future instead of being scared of it. The only side effects I experienced were a little bit of nausea and feeling tired (this lasted the first two weeks, but it’s gone now.) Everyone reacts differently to medication, so don’t let the bad reviews scare you!\"\n",

I had high anxiety, I couldn't leave my house, and most of the days I have spent in bed. On weeks 7-8, I literally thought I would come off this medication, but I waited and saw my doctor. We have increased the dose to 40mg (2 tablets a day). It has been 2 weeks now, and I must say I feel such a change. I am able to think again, I go to bed smiling, and did not spend a single day in bed. I feel more comfortable doing the house chores, it doesn't seem impossible anymore. Not sure if it works for everyone, but it's worth the wait. Seems like the 20mg just wasn't enough for me, 40mg changed my life so far. I PRAY TO GOD IT WILL STAY LIKE THIS. If it does, I know I will be getting my life back. Ps. I was diagnosed with severe depression and post-traumatic disorder/amnesia.\"\n",

I don’t have panic attacks, I can breathe, I sleep better, and don’t get stressed over tiny things. I still have negative thoughts but let them go immediately. I feel like I’m a nicer person, and I feel like I can listen to other people again without my thoughts taking over. On day 14 of 20mg and staying on this dose at the moment.

I used to use food as a way to cope with my emotions. Now that is not the case, I eat normally and anxiety does not plague my life. No more obsessive thinking over small things. I have nothing but good things to say about Prozac. Honestly, I just wished I had taken it sooner, but now I am just glad I am able to live life, no more being held prisoner inside my own mind.

I was already at an unbearable level with my anxiety & the Prozac did increase it for me for around 2 weeks. After around 3 weeks I started to feel good. I can drive again, I’m starting to enjoy being outside & doing things. I’m a lot happier, settled & at least 80% less anxious. I still have moments & I’m definitely not cured but I’m managing. Side effects for me are vivid dreams, loss of appetite & some weight loss. In the beginning, side effects were insomnia, increased anxiety, intrusive thoughts & agoraphobia. I got through it & it was like the sun finally came out once they started working. I spent hours researching & reading reviews, scaring myself silly. If you’re doing that also, I can’t say what it will do for you as everyone is different but for me, it has improved my life. If I can get through those 1st tough 2 weeks, anyone can.\"\n",

Before I was on Seroquel XR, and that was terrible because that made me feel so strange all the time. I finally got off of that and tried Prozac because I’ve always dealt with OCD and Intrusive thoughts. I cannot express how true every review is about the first couple of weeks, 3-4 weeks and you won’t feel anything really. To be honest, my anxiety was a little stronger, but trust me when I tell you it is all well worth it. I honestly feel amazing now. I can just think better and more clearly, and now I understand my intrusive thoughts are only thoughts, they aren’t my actions. Man, I used to fight with my thoughts all the time and ask why did I think that, why did I think this. Now, I understand so much more about myself and who I am and who I want to be. I was running out of hope because I just couldn’t shake my OCD tendencies and intrusive thoughts, but just give the medication time to work, your body is adjusting to it.\"\n",

I did this, and it put way too many ideas into my head when I finally started taking Prozac. I put off taking this medication for far too long, and finally caved in to taking it when my anxiety started causing me to fall into depression. I was too afraid to even go to sleep by myself before taking this, and within my first dose (only 10mg), I slept through the night all by myself. Every day I have continued to feel a bit better. 1st month I started taking 10mg, and by month 2, I am now on 20mg. Before taking this, I was suffering with panic attacks multiple times a week, and now haven’t had one since I started. The power of medication is truly amazing. Once you start, stay strong, and power through! Be patient. Even if this medication isn’t the right fit for you, don’t fret, there are plenty of other options available. You will get through this!! Start taking your meds TODAY!\"\n",

I went back on 10, and every time I go up on dosage I bleed again. I look back now and see that suffered from anxiety for so much longer than needed to, I couldn't be more happier to have taken that chance and I want to encourage you not to be afraid because the pros beat the cons. Also before Prozac, I had EXTREMELY bad stomach issues, and taking Prozac has dramatically helped my pain. Also my dreams are CRAZY. They are always nightmares and often wake me, sweating. My doctor prescribed me a drug called clonidine only 0.1 mg and I've been taking it for 3 nights and my sleep and nightmares have gotten much better already.

I slowly had happier thoughts. After a month, my dosage was increased to 20 mg and the first week of that, I actually started feeling a little depressed again, but after a week and a half, my mood elevated. I started getting involved in activities again. I started hanging out with my family and friends again. I make an effort to do my hair and makeup, work out, work on goals... I'm back to me. I'm truly happy. Prozac saved my life... for real. I feel a part of this world again when at one point in time I didn't want to be a part of this world. It works, it just takes time.

I would cry so much from becoming overly stressed. Now, I feel a significant change. I am much more calm in stressful situations. I also don't cry or get angry easily. I'm young, so my parents let me decide if I wanted to try the medication. I was worried about all the side effects, but after some overthinking, I decided to try it out. It took about 1 and a half months to start feeling a change, and I wish I took it earlier. I 100% recommend this medication to anyone with anxiety.

I was dealing with so much OCD & Anxiety - From intrusive thoughts, to literally doing things over & over again, to realizing it wasn’t the thing that I was doing that was bothering me, it was that I didn’t know how to control my OCD. I was completely lacking self-control in every way, shape & form. But man, I’ll tell you. The first month on Prozac, I didn’t feel any different. Honestly, I felt worse, but that was because my body was adjusting & I wasn’t being patient. I wanted immediate results & I still was lacking self-control!

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I was encouraged by my psychiatrist to try Prozac for the first time, 20 mg a day. I spent many, many years always worried about other people's feelings to the point of overthinking things constantly. Worrying what people thought of me and I had low self-esteem and low self-opinion. Social anxiety was always a serious problem for me also. With that being said, anxiety and worry crept into full-blown depression. So my doctor put me on Prozac 20 mg. At first, it made me a little drowsy, but it gave me a way better feeling of calmness, peace, and basically not worried at all about little things or what people thought of me. And after about a month, all of those chronic worry, stress, and fears were totally gone. Totally. In my own personal experience, Prozac allowed me to tackle the important things of life and not worry or even think of petty things and other people's behavior. It basically gets rid of toxic stress and worry. And makes you mentally 'strong' if that makes sense.\"\n",

      "For Obsessive Compulsive Disorder \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I don’t find a lot of positive stories about antidepressants, or I find stories where people are taking the antidepressant the wrong way. I wanted to share my experience. A positive one. I’ve had generalized anxiety disorder, SEVERE OCD, and panic disorder for as long as I can remember. My first memory of having an episode was when I was 4 years old at my kindergarten interview. I feel as though I was born with the illnesses mentioned above, right from the womb. When I was a child I was extremely anxious, had bad separation anxiety from my parents, and had extreme OCD. I was just a kid and thought that the way I was feeling is how all kids felt, I didn’t realize that I was different. This went on, and got even worse in middle school. I began developing trichotillomania in middle school. In high school, I went from being a 90% above student to failing every class within a couple of years. I couldn’t leave the house. My panic disorder and GAD caused debilitating physical symptoms. I would be shaking when I had to leave the house, I wouldn’t drink alcohol because I was afraid of vomiting, I was suffering so much, for my whole entire life with severe phobias, fears, and anxiety. I prayed and prayed and prayed to God every night for it to go away. I was a 16-year-old living in a prison of her own mind. It never went away. Every single day was the worst day of my life, I would wake up and the thoughts just started, I never had a break. My life was exhausting. I am of East Indian background, and my parents didn’t understand mental illness well. It is very taboo in my culture. I went to tons of doctors, and they told me it was just growing pains, no doctor ever told me that maybe I should see a therapist. I didn’t have any support. When I was 22, I attempted suicide. Luckily, the attempt didn’t work, and I was forced to go on medication. I was livid, I was so against antidepressants, I was so, so, so scared, it felt unnatural. My general practitioner put me on Effexor. I took it for almost 8 weeks, it helped me to not want to kill myself, but it also made me gain tons of weight which made me depressed, and it made me hear voices. One evening a voice told me to choke my mom, and I started freaking out, and my parents drove me immediately to the hospital. At the hospital, I talked to a psych nurse who calmed me down, and got me an appointment with a psychiatrist the next day. This appointment and this psychiatrist saved my life, and changed my entire life. I want to really mention that you should not be going to a General Practitioner for mental illness medication, you should ALWAYS, ALWAYS go to a psychiatrist no matter what. If your GP is the only person you are seeing to help you manage your meds for OCD, anxiety, etc, that is the WRONG MOVE. That is such a common mistake people are making, you NEED a psychiatrist in order to get the meds right, please do not just go to your regular doctor, you’ll be cheating yourself. I went to the psychiatrist appointment the next day. It was the first time I had ever seen a psychiatrist. I got into her room, and we talked about everything: my childhood, my phobias, my OCD. She then brought my parents into the room to explain the whole situation to them and the fact that I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and that I have been suffering for way too long. My parents were so supportive. The doctor told me I was on the wrong medication, that I never should have been placed on Effexor which is an SNRI, and that I should be on an SSRI considering my main problem is OCD and GAD. We talked a lot about it, and she told me she would like to place me on Prozac. She said for me, because my neural pathways have been the same for 20 plus years, that I would need a higher dosage of Prozac especially for anxiety and OCD. I see on this forum, that so many people are on 20mg, or 40mg for anxiety disorders. You should be on 60mg at least, do not be afraid to go higher. People that say Prozac or an SSRI didn’t really do anything for their anxiety or OCD is because they are only taking a 20mg dose, That is not an OCD dose. 40-80mg for anxiety and OCD. Please up your dose. Use the medication, REALLY USE IT. Do not be afraid! My doctor started me on 40mg, eventually took me to 100mg, and then I went back to 80mg. Yes, the side effects are insane, I was nauseated, I couldn’t sleep, I was shaking, I had anxiety, but she prescribed me Ativan and said to use it until the Prozac kicked in. That the Ativan would keep me comfortable until that happened. Don’t try to be a hero, use your Ativan or your Xanax or whatever to stay as comfortable as possible. I could write so much more, but I’ll conclude with this. 4 months after being on 80mg of Prozac every day, I woke up one day and I was cured. Yes, cured. I had no OCD, I had no anxiety, I no longer had fears or phobias. I was cured. You have no idea how that day felt. It was like the first day of my whole entire life. I woke up being the real me, who is free-spirited and isn’t afraid of anything! I was finally free, I was no longer a prisoner. I didn’t even have to go to therapy. I just woke up one day a brand new person, from taking a high dose of Prozac every single day. DO NOT go off of the antidepressants. Your OCD, your anxiety, depression etc will come back. I WOULD never dream or even think to come off of my antidepressants, I have an illness, that will return if I go off the medication, because I have a brain disorder. OCD is a brain disorder. Do not stop taking medication for your brain disorder, do not try to fix your brain disorder with just a 20mg or 40mg dose. Own your medication, be on it for life. It’s been 5 years since I have been cured. If it wasn’t for Prozac, I would be dead. 1) You need a psychiatrist 2) Do not be afraid to take more than 40mg of Prozac to treat panic attacks etc, I am on 80mg a day and my life is a ball. It is so wonderful and so carefree. 3) Do not stop the meds. Be on the meds for life.\"\n",

I used to use food as a way to cope with my emotions. Now that is not the case, I eat normally and anxiety does not plague my life. No more obsessive thinking over small things.

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I’ve been on Prozac for 7 weeks now. I started 10mg & increased to 20mg after 10 days. I absolutely did feel worse before I felt better. I was already at an unbearable level with my anxiety & the Prozac did increase it for me for around 2 weeks. After around 3 weeks I started to feel good. I can drive again, I’m starting to enjoy being outside & doing things. I’m a lot happier, settled & at least 80% less anxious. I still have moments & I’m definitely not cured but I’m managing. Side effects for me are vivid dreams, loss of appetite & some weight loss. In the beginning, side effects were insomnia, increased anxiety, intrusive thoughts & agoraphobia. I got through it & it was like the sun finally came out once they started working. I spent hours researching & reading reviews, scaring myself silly. If you’re doing that also, I can’t say what it will do for you as everyone is different but for me, it has improved my life. If I can get through those 1st tough 2 weeks, anyone can.\"\n",

Before I was on Seroquel XR, and that was terrible because that made me feel so strange all the time. I finally got off of that and tried Prozac because I’ve always dealt with OCD and Intrusive thoughts. I cannot express how true every review is about the first couple of weeks, 3-4 weeks and you won’t feel anything really. To be honest, my anxiety was a little stronger, but trust me when I tell you it is all well worth it. I honestly feel amazing now. I can just think better and more clearly, and now I understand my intrusive thoughts are only thoughts, they aren’t my actions. Man, I used to fight with my thoughts all the time and ask why did I think that, why did I think this. Now, I understand so much more about myself and who I am and who I want to be. I was running out of hope because I just couldn’t shake my OCD tendencies and intrusive thoughts, but just give the medication time to work, your body is adjusting to it.\"\n",

I put off taking this medication for far too long, and finally caved in to taking it when my anxiety started causing me to fall into depression. I was too afraid to even go to sleep by myself before taking this, and within my first dose (only 10mg), I slept through the night all by myself. Every day I have continued to feel a bit better. 1st month I started taking 10mg, and by month 2, I am now on 20mg. Before taking this, I was suffering with panic attacks multiple times a week, and now haven’t had one since I started. The power of medication is truly amazing. Once you start, stay strong, and power through! Be patient. Even if this medication isn’t the right fit for you, don’t fret, there are plenty of other options available. You will get through this!! Start taking your meds TODAY!\"\n",

I went back on 10, and every time I go up on dosage I bleed again. I look back now and see that suffered from anxiety for so much longer than needed to, I couldn't be more happier to have taken that chance and I want to encourage you not to be afraid because the pros beat the cons. Also before Prozac, I had EXTREMELY bad stomach issues, and taking Prozac has dramatically helped my pain. Also my dreams are CRAZY. They are always nightmares and often wake me, sweating. My doctor prescribed me a drug called clonidine only 0.1 mg and I've been taking it for 3 nights and my sleep and nightmares have gotten much better already.

I slowly had happier thoughts. After a month, my dosage was increased to 20 mg and the first week of that, I actually started feeling a little depressed again, but after a week and a half, my mood elevated. I started getting involved in activities again. I started hanging out with my family and friends again. I make an effort to do my hair and makeup, work out, work on goals... I'm back to me. I'm truly happy. Prozac saved my life... for real. I feel a part of this world again when at one point in time I didn't want to be a part of this world. It works, it just takes time.

I would cry so much from becoming overly stressed. Now, I feel a significant change. I am much more calm in stressful situations. I also don't cry or get angry easily. I'm young, so my parents let me decide if I wanted to try the medication. I was worried about all the side effects, but after some overthinking, I decided to try it out.

I was dealing with so much OCD & Anxiety - From intrusive thoughts, to literally doing things over & over again, to realizing it wasn’t the thing that I was doing that was bothering me, it was that I didn’t know how to control my OCD. I was completely lacking self-control in every way, shape & form. But man, I’ll tell you. The first month on Prozac, I didn’t feel any different. Honestly, I felt worse, but that was because my body was adjusting & I wasn’t being patient. I wanted immediate results & I still was lacking self-control!

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I was encouraged by my psychiatrist to try Prozac for the first time, 20 mg a day. I spent many, many years always worried about other people's feelings to the point of overthinking things constantly. Worrying what people thought of me and I had low self-esteem and low self-opinion. Social anxiety was always a serious problem for me also. With that being said, anxiety and worry crept into full-blown depression. So my doctor put me on Prozac 20 mg. At first, it made me a little drowsy, but it gave me a way better feeling of calmness, peace, and basically not worried at all about little things or what people thought of me. And after about a month, all of those chronic worry, stress, and fears were totally gone. Totally. In my own personal experience, Prozac allowed me to tackle the important things of life and not worry or even think of petty things and other people's behavior. It basically gets rid of toxic stress and worry. And makes you mentally 'strong' if that makes sense.\"\n",

      "For Obsessive Compulsive Disorder \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I don’t find a lot of positive stories about antidepressants, or I find stories where people are taking the antidepressant the wrong way. I wanted to share my experience. A positive one. I’ve had generalized anxiety disorder, SEVERE OCD, and panic disorder for as long as I can remember. My first memory of having an episode was when I was 4 years old at my kindergarten interview. I feel as though I was born with the illnesses mentioned above, right from the womb. When I was a child I was extremely anxious, had bad separation anxiety from my parents, and had extreme OCD. I was just a kid and thought that the way I was feeling is how all kids felt, I didn’t realize that I was different. This went on, and got even worse in middle school. I began developing trichotillomania in middle school. In high school, I went from being a 90% above student to failing every class within a couple of years. I couldn’t leave the house. My panic disorder and GAD caused debilitating physical symptoms. I would be shaking when I had to leave the house, I wouldn’t drink alcohol because I was afraid of vomiting, I was suffering so much, for my whole entire life with severe phobias, fears, and anxiety. I prayed and prayed and prayed to God every night for it to go away. I was a 16-year-old living in a prison of her own mind. It never went away. Every single day was the worst day of my life, I would wake up and the thoughts just started, I never had a break. My life was exhausting. I am of East Indian background, and my parents didn’t understand mental illness well. It is very taboo in my culture. I went to tons of doctors, and they told me it was just growing pains, no doctor ever told me that maybe I should see a therapist. I didn’t have any support. When I was 22, I attempted suicide. Luckily, the attempt didn’t work, and I was forced to go on medication. I was livid, I was so against antidepressants, I was so, so, so scared, it felt unnatural. My general practitioner put me on Effexor. I took it for almost 8 weeks, it helped me to not want to kill myself, but it also made me gain tons of weight which made me depressed, and it made me hear voices. One evening a voice told me to choke my mom, and I started freaking out, and my parents drove me immediately to the hospital. At the hospital, I talked to a psych nurse who calmed me down, and got me an appointment with a psychiatrist the next day. This appointment and this psychiatrist saved my life, and changed my entire life. I want to really mention that you should not be going to a General Practitioner for mental illness medication, you should ALWAYS, ALWAYS go to a psychiatrist no matter what. If your GP is the only person you are seeing to help you manage your meds for OCD, anxiety, etc, that is the WRONG MOVE. That is such a common mistake people are making, you NEED a psychiatrist in order to get the meds right, please do not just go to your regular doctor, you’ll be cheating yourself. I went to the psychiatrist appointment the next day. It was the first time I had ever seen a psychiatrist. I got into her room, and we talked about everything: my childhood, my phobias, my OCD. She then brought my parents into the room to explain the whole situation to them and the fact that I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and that I have been suffering for way too long. My parents were so supportive. The doctor told me I was on the wrong medication, that I never should have been placed on Effexor which is an SNRI, and that I should be on an SSRI considering my main problem is OCD and GAD. We talked a lot about it, and she told me she would like to place me on Prozac. She said for me, because my neural pathways have been the same for 20 plus years, that I would need a higher dosage of Prozac especially for anxiety and OCD. I see on this forum, that so many people are on 20mg, or 40mg for anxiety disorders. You should be on 60mg at least, do not be afraid to go higher. People that say Prozac or an SSRI didn’t really do anything for their anxiety or OCD is because they are only taking a 20mg dose, That is not an OCD dose. 40-80mg for anxiety and OCD. Please up your dose. Use the medication, REALLY USE IT. Do not be afraid! My doctor started me on 40mg, eventually took me to 100mg, and then I went back to 80mg. Yes, the side effects are insane, I was nauseated, I couldn’t sleep, I was shaking, I had anxiety, but she prescribed me Ativan and said to use it until the Prozac kicked in. That the Ativan would keep me comfortable until that happened. Don’t try to be a hero, use your Ativan or your Xanax or whatever to stay as comfortable as possible. I could write so much more, but I’ll conclude with this. 4 months after being on 80mg of Prozac every day, I woke up one day and I was cured. Yes, cured. I had no OCD, I had no anxiety, I no longer had fears or phobias. I was cured. You have no idea how that day felt. It was like the first day of my whole entire life. I woke up being the real me, who is free-spirited and isn’t afraid of anything! I was finally free, I was no longer a prisoner. I didn’t even have to go to therapy. I just woke up one day a brand new person, from taking a high dose of Prozac every single day. DO NOT go off of the antidepressants. Your OCD, your anxiety, depression etc will come back. I WOULD never dream or even think to come off of my antidepressants, I have an illness, that will return if I go off the medication, because I have a brain disorder. OCD is a brain disorder. Do not stop taking medication for your brain disorder, do not try to fix your brain disorder with just a 20mg or 40mg dose. Own your medication, be on it for life. It’s been 5 years since I have been cured. If it wasn’t for Prozac, I would be dead. 1) You need a psychiatrist 2) Do not be afraid to take more than 40mg of Prozac to treat panic attacks etc, I am on 80mg a day and my life is a ball. It is so wonderful and so carefree. 3) Do not stop the meds. Be on the meds for life.\"\n",

      "For Depression \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Man, what a journey I went on with medicines before Prozac :/. Before I was on Seroquel XR, and that was terrible because that made me feel so strange all the time. I finally got off of that and tried Prozac because I’ve always dealt with OCD and Intrusive thoughts. I cannot express how true every review is about the first couple of weeks, 3-4 weeks and you won’t feel anything really. To be honest, my anxiety was a little stronger, but trust me when I tell you it is all well worth it. I honestly feel amazing now. I can just think better and more clearly, and now I understand my intrusive thoughts are only thoughts, they aren’t my actions. Man, I used to fight with my thoughts all the time and ask why did I think that, why did I think this. Now, I understand so much more about myself and who I am and who I want to be. I was running out of hope because I just couldn’t shake my OCD tendencies and intrusive thoughts, but just give the medication time to work, your body is adjusting to it.\"\n",

I did this, and it put way too many ideas into my head when I finally started taking Prozac. I put off taking this medication for far too long, and finally caved in to taking it when my anxiety started causing me to fall into depression. I was too afraid to even go to sleep by myself before taking this, and within my first dose (only 10mg), I slept through the night all by myself. Every day I have continued to feel a bit better. 1st month I started taking 10mg, and by month 2, I am now on 20mg. Before taking this, I was suffering with panic attacks multiple times a week, and now haven’t had one since I started. The power of medication is truly amazing. Once you start, stay strong, and power through! Be patient. Even if this medication isn’t the right fit for you, don’t fret, there are plenty of other options available. You will get through this!! Start taking your meds TODAY!\"\n",

I went back on 10, and every time I go up on dosage I bleed again. I look back now and see that suffered from anxiety for so much longer than needed to, I couldn't be more happier to have taken that chance and I want to encourage you not to be afraid because the pros beat the cons. Also before Prozac, I had EXTREMELY bad stomach issues, and taking Prozac has dramatically helped my pain. Also my dreams are CRAZY. They are always nightmares and often wake me, sweating. My doctor prescribed me a drug called clonidine only 0.1 mg and I've been taking it for 3 nights and my sleep and nightmares have gotten much better already.

I slowly had happier thoughts. After a month, my dosage was increased to 20 mg and the first week of that, I actually started feeling a little depressed again, but after a week and a half, my mood elevated. I started getting involved in activities again. I started hanging out with my family and friends again. I make an effort to do my hair and makeup, work out, work on goals... I'm back to me. I'm truly happy. Prozac saved my life... for real. I feel a part of this world again when at one point in time I didn't want to be a part of this world. It works, it just takes time.

I remember before going to school, I would have panic attacks, I would stress so much I'd become sick, and I would shake and sweat badly from the stress. I would cry so much from becoming overly stressed. Now, I feel a significant change. I am much more calm in stressful situations. I also don't cry or get angry easily. I'm young, so my parents let me decide if I wanted to try the medication. I was worried about all the side effects, but after some overthinking, I decided to try it out. It took about 1 and a half months to start feeling a change, and I wish I took it earlier. I 100% recommend this medication to anyone with anxiety.

I was dealing with so much OCD & Anxiety - From intrusive thoughts, to literally doing things over & over again, to realizing it wasn’t the thing that I was doing that was bothering me, it was that I didn’t know how to control my OCD. I was completely lacking self-control in every way, shape & form. But man, I’ll tell you. The first month on Prozac, I didn’t feel any different. Honestly, I felt worse, but that was because my body was adjusting & I wasn’t being patient. I wanted immediate results & I still was lacking self-control! But let me tell you, after 2 months on this medicine, I AM ALIVE AGAIN!!! :) I can breathe properly, I can think properly, I understand what triggers my OCD. BE YOURSELF.\"\n",

The past months I have been dealing with unbearable anxiety and panic attacks that I could no longer manage. I gave in and have been on Prozac for 1 month now. The first week I had no side effects besides a headache. The second week came and the symptoms I had were obsessive thoughts, one bad panic attack, increased anxiety, feeling out of body, etc. This continued into week 3, but eventually got better.

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I was encouraged by my psychiatrist to try Prozac for the first time, 20 mg a day. I spent many, many years always worried about other people's feelings to the point of overthinking things constantly. Worrying what people thought of me and I had low self-esteem and low self-opinion. Social anxiety was always a serious problem for me also. With that being said, anxiety and worry crept into full-blown depression. So my doctor put me on Prozac 20 mg. At first, it made me a little drowsy, but it gave me a way better feeling of calmness, peace, and basically not worried at all about little things or what people thought of me. And after about a month, all of those chronic worry, stress, and fears were totally gone. Totally. In my own personal experience, Prozac allowed me to tackle the important things of life and not worry or even think of petty things and other people's behavior. It basically gets rid of toxic stress and worry. And makes you mentally 'strong' if that makes sense.\"\n",

      "For Obsessive Compulsive Disorder \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I don’t find a lot of positive stories about antidepressants, or I find stories where people are taking the antidepressant the wrong way. I wanted to share my experience. A positive one. I’ve had generalized anxiety disorder, SEVERE OCD, and panic disorder for as long as I can remember. My first memory of having an episode was when I was 4 years old at my kindergarten interview. I feel as though I was born with the illnesses mentioned above, right from the womb. When I was a child I was extremely anxious, had bad separation anxiety from my parents, and had extreme OCD. I was just a kid and thought that the way I was feeling is how all kids felt, I didn’t realize that I was different. This went on, and got even worse in middle school. I began developing trichotillomania in middle school. In high school, I went from being a 90% above student to failing every class within a couple of years. I couldn’t leave the house. My panic disorder and GAD caused debilitating physical symptoms. I would be shaking when I had to leave the house, I wouldn’t drink alcohol because I was afraid of vomiting, I was suffering so much, for my whole entire life with severe phobias, fears, and anxiety. I prayed and prayed and prayed to God every night for it to go away. I was a 16-year-old living in a prison of her own mind. It never went away. Every single day was the worst day of my life, I would wake up and the thoughts just started, I never had a break. My life was exhausting. I am of East Indian background, and my parents didn’t understand mental illness well. It is very taboo in my culture. I went to tons of doctors, and they told me it was just growing pains, no doctor ever told me that maybe I should see a therapist. I didn’t have any support. When I was 22, I attempted suicide. Luckily, the attempt didn’t work, and I was forced to go on medication. I was livid, I was so against antidepressants, I was so, so, so scared, it felt unnatural. My general practitioner put me on Effexor. I took it for almost 8 weeks, it helped me to not want to kill myself, but it also made me gain tons of weight which made me depressed, and it made me hear voices. One evening a voice told me to choke my mom, and I started freaking out, and my parents drove me immediately to the hospital. At the hospital, I talked to a psych nurse who calmed me down, and got me an appointment with a psychiatrist the next day. This appointment and this psychiatrist saved my life, and changed my entire life. I want to really mention that you should not be going to a General Practitioner for mental illness medication, you should ALWAYS, ALWAYS go to a psychiatrist no matter what. If your GP is the only person you are seeing to help you manage your meds for OCD, anxiety, etc, that is the WRONG MOVE. That is such a common mistake people are making, you NEED a psychiatrist in order to get the meds right, please do not just go to your regular doctor, you’ll be cheating yourself. I went to the psychiatrist appointment the next day. It was the first time I had ever seen a psychiatrist. I got into her room, and we talked about everything: my childhood, my phobias, my OCD. She then brought my parents into the room to explain the whole situation to them and the fact that I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and that I have been suffering for way too long. My parents were so supportive. The doctor told me I was on the wrong medication, that I never should have been placed on Effexor which is an SNRI, and that I should be on an SSRI considering my main problem is OCD and GAD. We talked a lot about it, and she told me she would like to place me on Prozac. She said for me, because my neural pathways have been the same for 20 plus years, that I would need a higher dosage of Prozac especially for anxiety and OCD. I see on this forum, that so many people are on 20mg, or 40mg for anxiety disorders. You should be on 60mg at least, do not be afraid to go higher. People that say Prozac or an SSRI didn’t really do anything for their anxiety or OCD is because they are only taking a 20mg dose, That is not an OCD dose. 40-80mg for anxiety and OCD. Please up your dose. Use the medication, REALLY USE IT. Do not be afraid! My doctor started me on 40mg, eventually took me to 100mg, and then I went back to 80mg. Yes, the side effects are insane, I was nauseated, I couldn’t sleep, I was shaking, I had anxiety, but she prescribed me Ativan and said to use it until the Prozac kicked in. That the Ativan would keep me comfortable until that happened. Don’t try to be a hero, use your Ativan or your Xanax or whatever to stay as comfortable as possible. I could write so much more, but I’ll conclude with this. 4 months after being on 80mg of Prozac every day, I woke up one day and I was cured. Yes, cured. I had no OCD, I had no anxiety, I no longer had fears or phobias. I was cured. You have no idea how that day felt. It was like the first day of my whole entire life. I woke up being the real me, who is free-spirited and isn’t afraid of anything! I was finally free, I was no longer a prisoner. I didn’t even have to go to therapy. I just woke up one day a brand new person, from taking a high dose of Prozac every single day. DO NOT go off of the antidepressants. Your OCD, your anxiety, depression etc will come back. I WOULD never dream or even think to come off of my antidepressants, I have an illness, that will return if I go off the medication, because I have a brain disorder. OCD is a brain disorder. Do not stop taking medication for your brain disorder, do not try to fix your brain disorder with just a 20mg or 40mg dose. Own your medication, be on it for life. It’s been 5 years since I have been cured. If it wasn’t for Prozac, I would be dead. 1) You need a psychiatrist 2) Do not be afraid to take more than 40mg of Prozac to treat panic attacks etc, I am on 80mg a day and my life is a ball. It is so wonderful and so carefree. 3) Do not stop the meds. Be on the meds for life.\"\n",

I hope it continues working as well as it has! I came here to read the comments because it's working almost too well. Heh. I hope it holds out.\"\n",

      "For Depression \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I've suffered with mental health issues since I was a teenager, and I am now nearly 30. I've tried different medications, such as sertraline and venlafaxine, and couldn't stand the side effects, so I gave up. This medication, Prozac, has been so helpful. Apart from yawning, I've had no other side effects. I have more energy, feel more productive, calmer, and a little more confident. I've only been on it for a month, and after the first week, I felt so much better. Hoping it will stay like this! BPD traits, anxiety, depression.\"\n",

      "For Depression \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"This medication is great for people who worry excessively. It softens the blows in life. I am thankful that this medicine is available to treat depression and anxiety. I have taken 40 mg per day for years. I remember what my life was like before this drug was prescribed to me. I am much better now. If you are reluctant to try this drug, please know that it has helped many people. I hope you are one of them.\"\n",

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I have battled anxiety for years. I have a supportive family, a loving husband and child, and could not understand why I wanted to sleep or cry the days away, the months away, the years away... My breaking point was my family was struggling to comprehend why I did not want to do anything we loved anymore or be active in our daily life. It hit me hard. I could not walk into a room of people without going into a panic. Prozac is the 3rd medicine I tried. I feel like a million dollars now. I am me again. I was on 10mg for 1 month and now 20mg a day. I'm crying as I write this because anxiety is real. It affected everything in my life. But not anymore. My fear and panic are gone. I can run circles around my loved ones! It's great.\"\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\n",
      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I started at 10 mg dose of Prozac for GAD and some depression. I took 10mg, and moved to 20mg and it made me bleed (menstrual bleed), like a period NOT in my pee. Blood in pee can be a negative side effect of Prozac, but my blood work was fine. I went back on 10, and every time I go up on dosage I bleed again. I look back now and see that suffered from anxiety for so much longer than needed to, I couldn't be more happier to have taken that chance and I want to encourage you not to be afraid because the pros beat the cons. Also before Prozac, I had EXTREMELY bad stomach issues, and taking Prozac has dramatically helped my pain. Also my dreams are CRAZY. They are always nightmares and often wake me, sweating. My doctor prescribed me a drug called clonidine only 0.1 mg and I've been taking it for 3 nights and my sleep and nightmares have gotten much better already. Although these drugs can have side effects, there are ways around them to make your life better. You are not alone, it gets better. Thank you everyone who's shared here, you are LOVED.\"\n",

      "For Depression \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I'm 30 and was battling clinical depression. I was initially prescribed 10 mg of Prozac 2 months ago. The first day I took it was almost like I had taken a sleeping pill. I FINALLY could sleep, but it didn't make me 'sleepy'. I actually had way more energy. My anxiety slowly stopped. I slowly had happier thoughts. After a month, my dosage was increased to 20 mg and the first week of that, I actually started feeling a little depressed again, but after a week and a half, my mood elevated. I started getting involved in activities again. I started hanging out with my family and friends again. I make an effort to do my hair and makeup, work out, work on goals... I'm back to me. I'm truly happy. Prozac saved my life... for real. I feel a part of this world again when at one point in time I didn't want to be a part of this world. It works, it just takes time. You will feel like nothing is happening for a while, but one day you'll just be happy and you'll actually notice it.\"\n",

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Hello! So I have been taking Prozac for my anxiety. It will be a year really soon. I definitely feel such a positive change in myself. I remember before going to school, I would have panic attacks, I would stress so much I'd become sick, and I would shake and sweat badly from the stress. I would cry so much from becoming overly stressed. Now, I feel a significant change. I am much more calm in stressful situations. I also don't cry or get angry easily. I'm young, so my parents let me decide if I wanted to try the medication. I was worried about all the side effects, but after some overthinking, I decided to try it out. It took about 1 and a half months to start feeling a change, and I wish I took it earlier. I 100% recommend this medication to anyone with anxiety. It has changed my life and it is one of the best decisions I've ever made!\"\n",

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Man, what a journey/nightmare. Dealing with OCD & Anxiety & intrusive thoughts is absolutely no joke. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. I swear I wouldn’t. But man I’ll tell you, PROZAC SAVED MY LIFE. Where do I even start? I was dealing with so much OCD & Anxiety - From intrusive thoughts, to literally doing things over & over again, to realizing it wasn’t the thing that I was doing that was bothering me, it was that I didn’t know how to control my OCD. I was completely lacking self-control in every way, shape & form. But man, I’ll tell you. The first month on Prozac, I didn’t feel any different. Honestly, I felt worse, but that was because my body was adjusting & I wasn’t being patient. I wanted immediate results & I still was lacking self-control! But let me tell you, after 2 months on this medicine, I AM ALIVE AGAIN!!! :) I can breathe properly, I can think properly, I understand what triggers my OCD. BE YOURSELF.\"\n",

I was prescribed Prozac over 6 months ago, but didn't have the courage to take it. I initially came here and read the reviews which freaked me out. The past months I have been dealing with unbearable anxiety and panic attacks that I could no longer manage. I gave in and have been on Prozac for 1 month now. The first week I had no side effects besides a headache. The second week came and the symptoms I had were obsessive thoughts, one bad panic attack, increased anxiety, feeling out of body, etc. This continued into week 3, but eventually got better. The middle of week 3 going on week 4 I feel very good! I have had little to no anxiety issues and can actually function in the world! This medication, plus therapy once a week, has been a good combination!\"\n",

Wellbutrin didn't really work that well for me and I've read a lot of positive reviews with only very few bad ones. I have Klonopin for any of the side effects I have. Thanks, guys, for the great reviews. Whoever is reading this, never ever give up. It will get better, I promise, and pray to the good Lord above. He is the only reason I'm still here. He can work miracles better than any medicine ever can. God bless you all.\"\n",

I couldn’t function like a normal person anymore, and it was a very dark time for me. My doctor put me on Prozac, and the first month I didn’t really notice a change. After the first month went by, everything got better for me. I noticed myself not worrying about OCD anymore and actually felt genuinely happy inside. It’s been 8 months on Prozac, and I can honestly say I love my life now, I’m truly happy and OCD isn’t something I’m controlled by anymore. Although it never goes away completely, it is now 100 percent manageable. :)\"\n",

      "For Anxiety and Stress \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"For anyone who is hesitant about trying an antidepressant like Prozac because maybe you have too much pride, or you're embarrassed that you have to take a pill every day to feel like yourself. I was suffering with anxiety and depression for about 5 years after a really traumatic car accident and refused to try anything. I'm in my early 20s; I thought I was too young. I only wished I would've listened to my body and mind sooner. Prozac changed my life. I only take 20mg and it is incredible. I feel happy. I feel calm. I feel like my old self. I haven't had any anxiety in months. I'm not moody. It's like that big dark cloud is finally gone. Don't be afraid to try this antidepressant. I'm a brand new me because of it. I feel invincible.\"\n",

      "['I have suffered with urine infections on and off for years and was always given Macrobid or trimethoprim which never cleared it up for long or completely, and also gave me severe side effects. A new doctor started me on Keflex and it has cleared it up properly - very minimal side effects if any.', 'I started with a bladder infection on Sunday. I was urinating every 10-15 minutes, and it was so painful and I felt a lot of pressure. I called the doctor, and I was put on Bactrim on Monday night. The Bactrim gave me the spins, constipation, and anxiety. It was a nightmare! After 5 doses of Bactrim, my infection kept getting worse. I called the doctor, and they switched me to Keflex. I started the Keflex at 9 pm, and in less than 24 hours, I felt much better. No side effects except a little bit of nausea and dizziness, so remember to eat when you take it. It is a miracle drug for urinary infections and bladder infections.', 'I was prescribed Keflex (Cephalexin) after having surgery to prevent infection, and wanted to add to the list of side effects. They do not mention acid reflux, which I had every time I took the capsule (4 times a day, for 10 days). Also women need to take a probiotic while on this medication as it decreases natural flora and you can get a yeast infection. I learned this the hard way by not eating enough yogurt while on this medication and not taking any probiotics. Just wanted to give a heads up and hopefully spare many women this highly uncomfortable experience.', \"I have a double whammy: I have interstitial cystitis (which feels like a constant bladder infection), and on top of that I'm prone to actual bladder infections. I've learned to be able to tell the difference between a bladder infection and a cystitis flare-up. I have a lot of drug allergies and cannot take sulfa drugs or Cipro, which are commonly prescribed for bladder infections. Keflex has been the only antibiotic that I can take that doesn't give me any side effects and gets rid of the infection. It's saved my bacon on numerous occasions. I also prophylactically take Acidophilus orally to avoid yeast infections. It all works like a charm. I have NEVER had a bad side effect from Keflex.\", \"I had recurring boils in one area. They would show up randomly so the dr. was never able to take a culture since they would come to a head and then pop whenever. He put me on a 20-day regimen of Keflex (500) and another ointment antibiotic that he told me to dab into my nose. He said for some odd reason, boils seem to start in the nose. I followed the instructions and had a minor recurrence several months later. I went immediately to see him so he put me back on Keflex. These boils were clustered and leaving scars in the area. They haven't recurred and the scars are gone. Since I caught them starting the 2nd time, they never had a chance to come to a head because I stayed on top of it. I highly recommend it for a skin bacterial infection.\", \"So I ended a Saturday at the ER. I ended up having a urinary infection, a severe one. The PA prescribed Keflex 500 mg for 7 days - it really helped after 2 days, but I noticed that it does bring out side effects on myself. I feel nauseous, tired, agitated, eyes feel hot, headaches. Even though I took 2 Advil, it was still there. I also feel super anxious, I've been having mood swings, I feel more sad, and somehow more depressed than I have been in the past. And I still have one more day to go.\", 'I was prescribed Keflex twice a day for 7 days for UTI but I only lasted 4 days. Before I took this medication I had some anxiety, but no other mental health issues besides my ADHD. The 2nd day I took it I became psychotic. I was severely depressed, paranoid, convinced everyone was talking about me or working against me. I cried all day.

Constantly felt like I was going to vomit & slept from the time I got home from work until the next morning when I got up for work. I have been on antibiotics before, but this was my first AND LAST time I will ever take this.', 'It helped in getting rid of my bladder infection, but I was out in the sun for half the day doing some work outside, and I got horribly burnt and a bad sun rash. So just try to avoid the sun while on this medication.', \"I was prescribed 500mg (Keflex) four times a day, for ten days. This was for a boil that I've had for eight years. I thought it was a pimple, but when it got worse than ever, I saw a doctor who confirmed it as a boil. They then proceeded to try lancing and squeezing it. I almost became unconscious, this is how bad it had become. Anyways, you are here for the drug review. The only side effect that I noticed was a slight tired feeling. I have anxiety, so I didn't take the pills until around a week after being prescribed, for a fear of side effects. There is nothing to be worried about, trust that it will help you. Now, my boil is completely gone and I can relax.\", 'Got multiple venomous spider bites on the left buttocks. Turned into a staph infection.

I was skeptical as I often cannot finish antibiotics due to the awful side effects. I am very sensitive to medicine. This one has had no side effects for me. With that being said, I do take a probiotic (Florajen) several hours before taking Keflex. The probiotic is taken 1 time per day while on antibiotics and is found in the pharmacy, as it has to be refrigerated. No prescription is required for probiotic.', 'Had a really bad UTI and was prescribed Keflex. I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to taking medications. I take Keflex with Zofran just as a precaution and also with food before I take it. No side effects besides some gas here and there. After taking the first dose my UTI symptoms started to go away within the first five or so hours. Keflex is always my go to when I have a UTI, it works so well!! Also after taking a pill I drink about 32oz of water with it', 'I had an abscess on my upper gum resulting from terrible dentist work. I had also been prescribed amoxicillin 500mg; however, after a week of taking amoxicillin, the pain/swelling did not go away, it got noticeably worse. However, after taking my first full dose of Keflex, swelling reduced and gradually faded out by the time my dosage was complete. Would highly recommend Keflex.', 'I usually never have side effects from antibiotics, but I had moderate dizziness and nausea. The nausea is not bad enough to send me to bed all day, but it does interfere with my daily schedule and leaves me extremely worn out and fatigued. It is frustrating. I have to take it four times a day for ten days.', \"I had to take a double dosage of Keflex. I weigh about 115 lbs and had to take Keflex 500 mg 4 times a day for 10 days. I didn't have any issues with side effects or drinking alcohol while on it. It was prescribed as a precaution after I accidentally got a cut on my leg that required 13 stitches. The only dissatisfactory attribute was the horrid sulfur smell of the capsules.\", \"Cystitis for what seems forever. Take Keflex 500mg when an attack occurs. Told later by chemist who knew how often I get cystitis, could go on preventative 250mg daily so saw Dr. who said OK. After being months free, Dr said no, go off it for a while. Three weeks later, worst dose of Cystitis ever. Luckily have Keflex on hand so along with Ural, will be seeing Dr. very soon. What's the risk of being on a preventative dose every day?\", \"I had a really bad cold and viral bronchitis, and I ended up with nasal cellulitis of all things (infection in my nose and on my face). I took this medication, and on day three, it was clearing up nicely, and by day 5, the infection is gone. I had virtually no side effects other than sleepiness, but I think that's normal when you're fighting an infection. I took 500 mg x 4 times a day, and I had no stomach or intestinal issues at all. It was great.\", \"Took it for 7 days for a tooth infection, took the pain away on the 3rd day, no adverse reactions.  Had a reaction to Bactrim so I was hesitant to take antibiotics, however I'm confident in Keflex now.  Stop stressing and take it.\", \"Had an ingrown toenail infection. Was given 500mg Keflex taken 4 times a day for 7 days. It is working and I have no pain in my toe. However, so far I've had diarrhea, stomach pain, tiredness and weakness, dizzy spells, yellow skin, loss of appetite, nausea, red scratchy eyes. So most of the usual stuff. The long and short of it is my toe will be healed as long as I can deal with the side effects for a few more days.\", 'Took 500mg dose of Keflex twice a day for one week - I had a UTI. Side effects were diarrhea, headaches, felt depressed, upset stomach & nausea. Now I’m having stomach cramping. Just hope the urinary tract infection I had is gone after taking this strong antibiotic.', 'I went to the emergency room for a tooth abscess and they prescribed me keflex 500mg four times a day for 10 days. I have had zero side effects. It worked fast and took the infection right away. I had a little sore throat the whole 7 days but I was sneezing before I took the keflex so it probably a virus or allergies. My throat looks fine. But  highly recommend Keflex cause there are barely any side effects.', 'Keflex 500 mg three times a day is slowly but surely getting rid of my folliculitis.

    "a=[['I have suffered with urine infections on and off for years and was always given Macrobid or trimethoprim which never cleared it up for long or completely, and also gave me severe side effects. A new doctor started me on Keflex and it has cleared it up properly - very minimal side effects if any.'], ['I started with a bladder infection on Sunday. I was urinating every 10-15 minutes, and it was so painful and I felt a lot of pressure. I called the doctor, and I was put on Bactrim on Monday night. The Bactrim gave me the spins, constipation, and anxiety. It was a nightmare! After 5 doses of Bactrim, my infection kept getting worse. I called the doctor, and they switched me to Keflex. I started the Keflex at 9 pm, and in less than 24 hours, I felt much better. No side effects except a little bit of nausea and dizziness, so remember to eat when you take it. It is a miracle drug for urinary infections and bladder infections.'], ['I was prescribed Keflex (Cephalexin) after having surgery to prevent infection, and wanted to add to the list of side effects. They do not mention acid reflux, which I had every time I took the capsule (4 times a day, for 10 days). Also women need to take a probiotic while on this medication as it decreases natural flora and you can get a yeast infection. I learned this the hard way by not eating enough yogurt while on this medication and not taking any probiotics. Just wanted to give a heads up and hopefully spare many women this highly uncomfortable experience.'], [\"I have a double whammy: I have interstitial cystitis (which feels like a constant bladder infection), and on top of that I'm prone to actual bladder infections. I've learned to be able to tell the difference between a bladder infection and a cystitis flare-up. I have a lot of drug allergies and cannot take sulfa drugs or Cipro, which are commonly prescribed for bladder infections. Keflex has been the only antibiotic that I can take that doesn't give me any side effects and gets rid of the infection. It's saved my bacon on numerous occasions. I also prophylactically take Acidophilus orally to avoid yeast infections. It all works like a charm. I have NEVER had a bad side effect from Keflex.\"], [\"I had recurring boils in one area. They would show up randomly so the dr. was never able to take a culture since they would come to a head and then pop whenever. He put me on a 20-day regimen of Keflex (500) and another ointment antibiotic that he told me to dab into my nose. He said for some odd reason, boils seem to start in the nose. I followed the instructions and had a minor recurrence several months later. I went immediately to see him so he put me back on Keflex. These boils were clustered and leaving scars in the area. They haven't recurred and the scars are gone. Since I caught them starting the 2nd time, they never had a chance to come to a head because I stayed on top of it. I highly recommend it for a skin bacterial infection.\"], [\"So I ended a Saturday at the ER. I ended up having a urinary infection, a severe one. The PA prescribed Keflex 500 mg for 7 days - it really helped after 2 days, but I noticed that it does bring out side effects on myself. I feel nauseous, tired, agitated, eyes feel hot, headaches. Even though I took 2 Advil, it was still there. I also feel super anxious, I've been having mood swings, I feel more sad, and somehow more depressed than I have been in the past. And I still have one more day to go.\"], ['I was prescribed Keflex twice a day for 7 days for UTI but I only lasted 4 days. Before I took this medication I had some anxiety, but no other mental health issues besides my ADHD. The 2nd day I took it I became psychotic.
