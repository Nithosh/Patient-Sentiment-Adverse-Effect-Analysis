      "[['Having been through two combat tours in the Army, psychologically I was not in great shape. Every vet is different, for me, I was basically crippled by GAD and sometimes had over 15 panic attacks a day, one rolling over into another. SSRIs (and I tried them all) helped, but not enough to get me on an even keel to function in the world. I was 24 when my psychiatrist put me on Klonopin. 9 years later, I have a wonderful wife, a beautiful son, and a career that brings me great pride. None of this would have been possible without the help I received from taking Klonopin. There’s a lot of bias against benzos, and it is very true that they can be abused. But for people that truly need them, it’s a disservice to this potential lifesaver. It helped me take my life back. I’m grateful to have Klonopin in my toolbox even to this day. Seize the day, people, go out there and get busy living. If Klonopin or another benzo can help, then just do it. Life is too short.'], ['I’ve been on 2mg of Clonazepam for 3 years every night for insomnia. About 6 months ago, I suddenly was no longer able to fall asleep. My Dr. agreed that the benzo was no longer even working. He suggested I take 5 mg of liquid melatonin, and increase it by 5 mg every other night until I fell asleep easily. At 15 mg, I fell asleep easily! After taking the melatonin for 6 weeks, he had me cut my Clonazepam pill 25%. Still fell asleep great. At 10 days, he had me cut it 50%! Still, I fell asleep easily, and stayed asleep all night! I stayed at the 50% cut for 3 weeks, and then cut it down 75%! After 2 more weeks, I stopped taking it completely. I’ve had ZERO symptoms & sleep great. I still take the 15mg melatonin every night and that’s all. I know this is not a forum for discontinuation, but I wanted to share in case it could help someone else. I suffered for 10 years with horrible, horrible insomnia.'], ['I never took an aspirin until 3 years ago when not only did I suffer trauma and the ensuing PTSD at the ripe old age of 60, but I also was diagnosed with an incurable, chronic autoimmune disease. I am now 63, and after having tried multiple SSRIs, which do nothing, I was prescribed clonazepam. I take 1 mg once a day. I was warned about all the side effects...dependency, tolerance, etc., and quite frankly, I do not care. If this drug keeps me alive and calms my thoughts, and makes me want to live. My doctor is in full agreement with taking this for the rest of my days. Quality of life versus quantity... I have no intention of coming off of it... therefore withdrawal will not be an issue.'], [\"I get annoyed when I google Klonopin and all I see is scare tactics of how it's so dangerous. It has been a lifesaver for me for the last 5 years. I never abused it or ever even got the slightest remote high from it. I take 2mg in the morning and 2mg after 5 PM. It literally saved my career as the level of anxiety that came over me was horrible and the only drug that stopped my heart from pounding out of my chest is Klonopin.\"], [\"Just because your particular biochemistry had a bad reaction, does not mean a certain drug is bad for everyone. Benzos get a bad rep because of their dependency nature. I will tell you that I have suffered with anxiety and OCD for many years. I have tried other medicines. They have bad side effects. I have tried natural alternatives, although they do work a little bit - it's only a little bit. The upside is they rarely have any side effects. So if you can have a natural supplement work for you, go that route. However, I will say that I am someone that does not like to take pharm medicine and if I have the need for Klonopin, I only try to take it every few days or so. But I will tell you, when I do take it, it's absolutely the only thing that has worked. It does not make me feel weird, groggy, or zombie-like. It makes me feel back to my normal, natural me: calm, content, and just overall good! People who advocate against Klonopin are doing a disservice to people that the drug is helpful for.\"], [\"Had panic disorders all through high school and did nothing about it till 4th year of college. I've been on 1mg of Klonopin for 24 years and my dose has never increased or decreased. It truly changed my life for the good. Thank you for letting me share.\"], [\"I'm very aware of the dangers and the suffering of benzo withdrawal. I've gone through it multiple times and I'm only 25. However, I'm going to detail the successful tapering schedule I did using Klonopin. I was taking 2mg for two years and this is how I successfully got off. I did 1.75mg for a week, 1.5mg for a week, 1.25mg for a week, 1mg for a week, 0.875mg for a week, 0.75mg for a week, 0.625mg for a week, 0.5mg for a week, 0.325mg for a week, 0.25mg for a week, 0.125mg for a week, and then I jumped off. No, it wasn't easy, but it sure beat rapid withdrawal in a detox center and then going insane for months. I suggest trying what I did and you can prolong the cuts as well. Instead of holding for one week, hold for two, three, or a month. Be well everyone and good luck with the fight!\"], [\"This medication is not for everyone, but the stigma within the medical community is making it difficult for people who desperately need it to get access. This medication is the best thing I have ever used for my anxiety. I have never had any success with antidepressants (I've tried all classes); they all made me sick, more anxious, and some even caused serotonin syndrome (which clonazepam saved me from too). This medication helps me learn how to grow from my anxiety, helps me sleep better, and most of all works amazingly. Taking it is honestly like a built-in therapy session because I learn about my toxic actions that are absent when I'm not anxious. I only take it when absolutely needed. I love it so much, please be kind to people who use this as their medication monotherapy.\"], [\"I work in healthcare, and obviously the last six months have been very stressful with COVID. I've had crazy body symptoms and crazy thoughts running through my mind. Klonopin has been a huge help in allowing me to work and remain centered and calm. In fact, I'm probably wondering if I should have been on this medicine for the last 30 years. Give it time, and the fatigue will go away, and the clear, calm mind will come. That's how it worked for me.\"], [\"I've been on numerous medications over the last 20 years, including Xanax. About 15 years ago, my doctor put me on Klonopin. For the first time, I felt better. About 5 years later, I switched insurance companies and had my new doctor switch me to Xanax, which worked fine. After that, I've had about 4 different psychiatrists and none of them liked Xanax, so they took me off of them and put me on other meds that did not work. So I've suffered for the last 4 years. I have PTSD and anxiety. Finally, I just got a new psychiatrist, and she put me back on Klonopin, and I'm so relieved. I feel so much better. Don't let anyone tell you it's a bad medication. I never had withdrawals years ago when I quit taking them. They have helped me better than any other medication.\"], [\"So, I wanted to write a recent review for people who are considering taking Klonopin. First and foremost, I was prescribed Zoloft last year in the summer, and it helped me for about 6 months, and then it stopped working for me. My doctor prescribed me Lexapro, and that seems to be helping me a lot, but I still have panic attacks from time to time. I asked my doctor about taking Klonopin because I've heard such great things about this drug from others who also have panic attacks and bad anxiety. I was prescribed 0.5mg but was told to cut it in half to 0.25mg, and honestly, guys, it has helped me TREMENDOUSLY! When I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack, I take what I am prescribed, and it does make me sleepy, but I sleep so peacefully, and I'm fine for days. Praying that my review will help someone!\"], ['I am a nurse and was so anti-psych-based medication until COVID hit. I lost my job due to not being able to work an odd shift. I started having panic, anxiety, and paranoia. I have a huge phobia with medication that it will cause every side effect. I finally was brave enough to try 0.25 mg. This medication has changed my life for the good thus far. At one point I could not drive/function due to panic, and this has made things much easier.'], [\"Having insomnia is so scary. I finally got a doctor who was willing to prescribe clonazepam for me. While I know taking Klonopin every night is bad, when you can't sleep at all and you fear going to bed, Klonopin is a godsend. I believe having sleep helps your health, which we all need. I feel like myself again.\"], [\"Many people are unreasonably scared of Klonopin's bad withdrawal dramas. Well... It is true. It is a painful process to get away from Klonopin once you stepped into its comfortable zone, but I want to say I would rather feel relaxed and comfortable than struggling with unnecessary anxiety caused by neurotransmitter imbalances. This medication truly gave me freedom from fear and agitation and helped me get back to my life.\"], [\"On Klonopin for anxiety and insomnia. Klonopin saved my life. It also improved every relationship I treasure. I've taken it for 8 years and my work has improved, my relationships have improved, and I'm more relaxed. Also, my base dose has not increased beyond 1.0 mg a day. Often it's just 0.25 mg a day. Personally, I don't have any plan to stop taking it. My wife says I'm better in everyday on it, including the bedroom. So there... :)\"], ['I started taking Xanax after I lost my job and then my wife to brain cancer. My psychiatrist recommended Klonopin since it lasts longer. I started to wean myself off by taking smaller doses over a long period of time (4-6 weeks lowered each dose)... it’s now weeks with no meds and very little, if any, side effects... I’m 67... if I can do it... you can too!'], [\"Ok, here goes. Klonopin is by far the best drug for anxiety, period, for me. Everyone is different, of course, and I have never felt the need to take more than necessary. In fact, I always try to take less. SSRIs did nothing for me, in fact, they made me more anxious. Any drug, if taken too much or abused, can cause serious issues. Also, keep in mind who your reviewers are - me included. Most people who have a bad experience will review, good experiences don't even think about writing a review. I think the ratings would be closer to 9.5 if everyone took the time to write a positive review. As we all know, people are more likely to comment when they have negative outcomes, and that’s understandable. People who take this medication also tend to have anxiety, panic, GAD like myself, and can be very in touch with every perceived symptom within their body. In my opinion, way more than the average Joe walking down the street. In other words, take these reviews for what they are worth - a single person's opinion, and often a person who is suffering to find anything that will make them feel better.\"], ['Ok, so here’s the thing. This medication was recommended to me after I told my doctor that I no longer wanted to use Xanax given its newly acquired bad reputation. I’m on 0.5 (an immensely small dose) and it’s helped tremendously. Lost multiple friends and family members this year, and my stress levels have been through the roof. On such a small dose, both my mother (a licensed practitioner) and my doctor are not worried about it forming some sort of full-blown addiction. As needed is the way to be. Don’t take them “once a day as needed”; take them as YOU need them, not every day. Don’t worry about the side effects. Don’t worry about the stigma. Just heal. And if this happens to be an aid in healing for the time being, well, then so be it.'], [\"After suffering with insomnia my entire adult life, I've been using clonazepam for sleep for 12 years. 0.5 to 1 mg nightly. Sleep like a baby and wake feeling refreshed and really good. No side effects at all! If you suspect your insomnia is due to anxiety, you must give this a try.\"], [\"I've been on Klonopin for 9 years. And contrary to what critics say, I haven't needed to increase my dose in 9 years. I'm pretty sure Klonopin saved my life. It definitely has helped me to continue working as a healthcare worker. I know many physicians who take it and swear by it and that has always increased my confidence in using it long term. I hope to one day not need it but why would I worry about using a medicine that makes me a better husband, father, neighbor, and dentist? Of all the benzos, it's the only one I would take. I take 0.5mg in the morning and 0.5 to 1.0 mg at night. The drowsy effect wears off in weeks and I actually get a little surge of energy from it because I'm relaxed and my mental outlook becomes more optimistic. This medicine has been a Godsend for me.\"], [\"Withdrawing from this drug has been the worst experience of my life. On 0.5mg twice a day for five years, I wasn't told by my doctor that it is addictive and not for long-term use. I told the doctor I wanted to stop taking it, and he advised me to wean myself off it. After 3 months of reducing it, I stopped completely, and during the weaning process, I never experienced any withdrawal symptoms. Within a week they started: dizzy, ringing in my ears, tremors, terrible headaches, nausea, lack of appetite, and weight loss. Every time I feel a little better, all of the symptoms come back. I am told that this can go on for months. My advice, don't start on this drug.\"], [\"I was on clonazepam for 12 years - 0.5 twice daily with the larger dose at night to help me sleep. I never increased my dose. It allowed me to have a life, a business, and a relationship and be normal again. I am now in my late 50s, and our country has decided this medication can't be taken long term, so I weaned myself off them. It was horrible, and I miss the feeling of being relaxed. So far, nothing else has worked for my anxiety, and now it is a struggle every day. Clonazepam was a lifesaver for me, and although I feel much brighter mentally off it, I struggle so much with physical exhaustion, lack of sleep, and other issues. The side effects feel like they were worth it for my quality of life, but I am unable to access this medication. As I slide into my 60s, I feel like this should not be a time I have to relearn how to be a normal human again... :( I lose 20-30 hours per week of unproductive time, I have high blood pressure, horrible insomnia, pulled muscles in my body from stress...\"], [\"I am 60 and have been on Klonopin for over 20 years. I have tried everything under the sun, no kidding. I have not only anxiety, but chronic depression, bipolar disorder, limb jerking, panic attacks to the extreme. I am so sensitive to meds, it's scary. So when I find something that works, I stick with it. I usually only take the 'Brand Name' due to good insurance, or I couldn't. I'll tell you from experience, if you stick to an exact timeline for taking it, rather than as needed, you will do a lot better. I have never had any side effects from it, which is a blessing. It helps with all of the above. I took myself off about 17 medications a doctor had me on. I call them stackers. For a while, I did not even know who I was. Now, I am stable, doing the best I ever have.\"], [\"Oh man...where to start. Well let me start with this, I fell in love with the contentment that this drug brought on. It took my anxiety and whisked it away like a hawk hovering overhead and about to devour its prey. Normalcy was a spell cast by a potion made up of medicine, contentment, and confidence. The truth with this drug is we learn to like things that change for the better. If you stop taking it, it would bring on bad symptoms made up of fear and uncertainty. Why risk that? This drug worked for me, and I'll take it forever. It doesn't mean we're addicts. It just means we're surviving. Best wishes to all.\"], [\"I have suffered from anxiety on and off throughout my life depending on circumstances going on around me. With the last 2+ years, lockdowns, isolation, starting a new job, I found a slow buildup coming for a while and it finally hit me about a month ago. I take Zoloft, but when I get really bad, Klonopin is an absolute life saver, LITERALLY. I just try to limit when and how I take it. I read my body and if it is evening time and I feel my panic and stress level rising and know I won't sleep, I take a 0.5mg and it helps very quickly. The physical toll anxiety has on your body to me is far worse than needing a helpful medication. I do not know where I would be without it, and I am 52 years old now. I still do positive things like meditation, exercise, eat well, and no alcohol, as well as a stress counselor. I feel this medication is the best solution for anxiety. I hope this post helps someone.\"]]\n",

It has really been amazing and I think that if the reviews scare you, just try it. You can always switch. I was terrified but everyone has a different body and reacts differently. You never know, this might be the best thing for you.'], [\"I've taken Levora, since I was 18, and am now 30. Not once have I noticed any issues except for a slight decrease in my sex drive. No weight gain, no cramps, very little mood swings(but that can be said for all, including men) my period lasts about three days and they are extremely light- to the point it can go unnoticed. I've also had unprotected sex for 11 years with the same man, and not once have I been pregnant, or even a close call. My period arrives at exactly the same time every month like clock work. It makes me feel like a normal human being. I might  have one day prior to staring my period, in which I feel a little funky; but it sure beats the alternative! I'd never switch, and if you're unsatisfied, try it!\"], [\"Very good birth control. I've been with 4 different birth control brands before this one, different progesterone and levels of it as well. I did my research and this is the birth control I picked and it's been wonderful. I've been on this birth control for 9 months. No mood swings, hardly nauseous, light period, no weight gain or loss, it's been perfect. \"], [\"I am a 27 year old first-time oral birth control user, and started on Levora 11 days ago. I know side effects are supposed to last for a few months then even out, but I don't know if I can handle a few months of this! It has hit me in phases! The first phase was headaches (which I never get normally!), breasts sore beyond belief, and exhaustion. That has now shifted to hot flashes with lightheadedness followed by anxiety and LOTS of crying! I have also been constantly nauseous. Thinking of food makes me nauseous, but I'm also starving and feel like I can't eat enough! All I can hope is that this is also a phase and it will even out and I'll just have to tough it out. But if it doesn't ease up I think I'll have to try a different pill. \"], [\"I have been taking Levora for about two years. Overall, it's great. Before Levora, I would break out each month before I started. My periods were very heavy and uncomfortable. Sometimes, my cramps would be so bad I would want to call into work. Now, my skin is clear. My periods are incredibly light and rarely painful. I am no longer a crazy person for two weeks out of every month. This is a winner.\"], [\"this drug actually helped me lose weight for some reason I exercise everyday and my diet has never been particularly bad but I wouldn't say it's good either and Ivery lost about 20 pounds since starting the drug. my acne is gone. occasional moodiness at the beginning of starting the medicine about 3 months ago but that evened out once my body got used to it.\"], [\"It does the job, obviously--I haven't been pregnant. But I have mood swings like I've never had before, I get anxious and/or depressed. Most despressingly, my sex drive has all but disappeared. Sex is uncomfortable, sometimes painful, and I seem incapable to naturally lubricate. I used to be able to have sex everyday if I wanted to and orgasm almost every time--not now.\"], [\"I waited 1 month to write this review. Hopefully things will stay the same. First of all, I read quite a few reviews before I took this pill. Let me tell you, I was terrified. I paid more attention to the bad reviews because with my luck I would suffer from every bad side effect of this pill. My main concern was weight gain and mood swings. I broke out but took control of it by going on proactive. It's working but I have to make sure to wash morning and night. No falling asleep will make up. My breasts were tender for the first couple of weeks, actually, it was quite painful. No weight gain. My appetite has actually decreased. I had bad PMS episodes and that's when I gained weight. This pill seems to help with that. Overall, I am happy.\"], [\"I have been taking Levora for about a year and a half now. It was definitely a rough start. I felt moody, like crazy moody, every single day for about a month when I started it. After that first month, it was smooth sailing. I love that it regulates my period. It comes on the same day, at the same time, every month (not to mention it only lasts 2-3 days and is super light!). I have experienced no weight gain and the only cramps I get are the day before my period, and the pain there is mild. Its a great option if you don't mind taking it every day. Oh, and did I mention it has done its job in preventing pregnancy.\"], [\"I've been on Levora for a month and a half. The first couple weeks I was super emotional and wanted to quit, but the emotions have gone away. I've gained maybe two pounds and my acne has mostly gone away. I've also noticed a decrease in facial hair.\"], [\"I've been on this for almost 5 years and I love it, in the last two years I've actually lost weight, my skin which used to be horrible with acne is nice and clear. The first few months were kind of rough, as it is when starting any birth control. The only downfall would be how sensitive my breasts can get when it's cold. Almost painful at times, but it's definitely eased over the years.\"], [\"I have used Levora for a long period of time and never had any issues to speak of. My appetite stayed low and my sex drive was better than without the pill. My weight was easier to maintain, and it never shot up like with other pills I have used. My periods were also not only always on time but became lighter and shorter the longer I was on it.  When I came off of it over this last year I gained about 50 pounds but in that time frame I also had a knee surgery so my activity dropped drastically from normal. I don't think I can complain about anything regarding this form of contraception. Didn't have migraines, depression or anything of the other symptoms/side effects.\"], ['This is my first experience with birth control, and so far it has been a very positive one.  I have been on it for about 2 months.  Before I had breakouts all of the time, and only a few days after starting this, I noticed that my acne had close to disappeared. Also, I used to have some problems with facial hair. That also has disappeared. I have had no mood swings, weight gain, or decrease in sexual drive or wetness. My weight has actually been easier to maintain, and I have lost about 10 pounds. All in all, this has been a great pill for me.'], ['Levora was my first birth control I have ever taken. I started birth control at 13 with my mother’s wishes and I haven’t had a single problem. I am now 19 going on 20 in 5 months and I know you’re supposed to switch birth control out after 5 years but when my doctor switched me my body completely rejected it with TERRIBLE side effects.

My dr. prescribed it for a short period of time, 6 months max. \\nI must say, I started bleeding heavily before the first ', \" period on the pack. I bled for nearly 2 weeks, which never happened before. Dr. office nurse said it was normal to get used to medication. Fine.\\nNow, I'm on the 4th month of taking Levora and I'm quitting it because I'm outraged that again, I have a heavy bleeding for nearly two weeks, and it's not even close to the \", \" mark on the blister. Again, that's very concerning, and causing my anxiety to spike. \\nI haven't noticed any weight gain, however, acne appeared on my face and chest, which hasn't happened since my teenage years. Also, noticed worsening symptoms of gas, bloating, cramping and pain in my ovaries.\"], ['I’ve been on Levora for exactly eight days now and I don’t know if it’s too early to tell, but my mood swings have been insane and I’ve been very sad which isn’t like me at all I’m a very happy and positive person but now I feel so down and lost it’s so weird. I’m pretty sure it’s the birth control though. I hope and pray that it goes away soon and I get use to the hormones because I’m going to have to go back to irregular periods and waiting four months until my next one smh :('], [\"I've used this medication for months and it saved my life! I used to have the heaviest periods. I would bleed through my pants almost everyday of my period no matter how much I changed my pad/tampon. With this medicine I never even have to worry about my period anymore! I have experienced no side effects or down sides to this pill. I absolutely recommend it for anyone who had a troublesome period. I love it!\"], [\"Honestly I remember taking this a long time ago and forgot why I stopped taking it because I switched tried an IUD back then. When I first got back on the pill I took Chateal which was great, was a little moody but otherwise fine. Still had periods which is fine with me because it let me know I'm still fertile and all (piece of mind). As soon as I was switched to Levora my anxiety exploded, gastrointestinal issues like bloating which was painful, acne, missed periods, fatigue, nausea. After 2 months of seeing if things will settle I've stopped taking it and made an appointment to get rid of it and replace it. I'd rather be pregnant than be on Levora.\"], [\"I've been on the Levora for birth control for about 5 years. The past few years I've been having a lot of gastrointestinal problems, bloating, belching, feeling full after small meals, feeling like food sits in my stomach and takes forever to digest. Have been to the GI doctor so many times to no avail. I stopped taking this pill and all of these symptoms disappeared. When I restarted this pill the symptoms returned with a vengeance after 4 days. I'm getting OFF it ASAP. But, now I'm terrified of trying another pill because these symptoms have made me miserable. After reading these reviews, I'm also wondering if my frequent headaches/occasional migraines will go away as well. Fingers crossed!\"], ['I have been on many different birth control methods for years now. None of then have worked for me. But when my doctor prescribed me Levora I was like ', ' Levora is the best thing that has ever happened to be. I now get my period for 3 days versus 7 days! I love this pill and I get no side effects.'], [\"I was on depo provera but I had such horrible side effects I couldn't handle it. I wanted a normal period again so I ended up starting levora to help regulate things and as my new form of birth control. Levora should have been my first choice. It corrected all of the issues the depo shot left me with and I couldn't be happier. The only side effect I have is sore breasts. That's it! No spotting, no mood swings, no weight gain! If you're having trouble finding a birth control that works for you I'd say try levora. Everyone is different and what works for some might not work for others but I think it's definitely worth a shot.\"], [\"I've been on this medication for 3 years. Women: realize that any time you switch birth control you will feel funny for a few months. Once you clear that hurdle, this medication is great. I have perfectly clear skin, light periods and have not gained a pound. I'm switching to Implanon only because I'm tired of remembering to take a pill every day.\"]]\n",

I read these reviews and was terrified of this pill but, for me, it honestly has made no difference in my life besides not being pregnant. The first couple of weeks I felt a little bloated, had some heartburn, and breast tenderness but these symptoms were not by any means terrible and 100% went away.

I took the first pill and then decided to just read up on it. I was scared out of my mind after reading reviews. I tried to calm myself down by saying that people usually only give reviews with a bad experience. Rarely do people seek these sites out to give a positive one. Nevertheless, I was scared. I thought I was going to gain weight, be an emotional crazy person, suffer from bad eyesight, etc. I was especially scared because I would take the pill at noon and at 5 pm every day I would feel nauseous. I changed my time to 5 pm, and hey, problem solved. I am usually in bed by the time the nausea would start.

I switched after 6 months of Lo Loestrin, which caused me to gain 10  pounds, constant spotting, and worse acne. With Microgestin, my periods are actually regular, and even lighter. I had horrible cramps that I used to have to miss school and work because of, and now, they're almost nonexistent! Zero weight gain, I've actually lost 7 pounds, and my acne is gone! Love this pill!\"], ['I think what a lot of women need to keep in mind is that all our bodies differ. Birth control is tricky. Doctors prescribe what they think is best and, sometimes, that’s not the case. It’s only unfortunate that we have to subject our bodies to something that can potentially endanger us at the say of our doctor. Really, there is no perfect, super effective birth control without another saying otherwise. So, here I am, part of that small percentage, that loves Microgestin Fe birth control. I’ve been on it for three years. No complaints. No weird side effects and have I gotten pregnant. What’s awesome, is that my period is very timely—I LOVE knowing even it’ll arrive (I get it every month, always on a Tuesday or Wednesday, no later than) and it only lasts 3, 4 days at most. If you’re sexually active, this has proven helpful in maintaining a very strict schedule with your menstrual cycle. Microgestin  birth control  is a winner in my book.'], ['I just started taking this birth control a week and a half ago. So far, so good. I have noticed a profound difference in my acne.

Usually I'm a very rational person,  but after taking them I have extreme mood swings, and minor disagreements turn into week-long fights.

I took birth control (Cyclessa and Yaz and some others I don't remember) in my early 20s and gained a bunch of weight and had a diminished sex drive.

My mood hasn't changed, I haven't gained weight (although I went from a C cup to a D cup) and, for the first time in years, my skin is clear. I had spotting the first two months I took it but that's gone away and now my period is super light.\"], [\"Whenever you start birth control, you're suppose to give it a three month trial before you determine if it's garbage or not. The reason being is because your body is adjusting to the new birth control, and of course you're going to experience break out bleeding, common birth control side effects, and of course being overly emotional. On the other hand, despite the break out bleeding and the mood swings I get from time to time, I love Microgestin! It's a reliable birth control if used correctly, so if you're forgetful, forget the pill and find another form of birth control!

My periods are so light and so manageable. I've had no problem with weight gain or mood swings with this pill. I am so sad to see this pill go on back order. I highly recommend. This is the only pill I have completely loved and not had any problems on.

It is completely normal to have side affects, your body won't regulate the pill until after about 3-4 months of consistent pill taking. I have been on microgestion for about 2-3 years and it lightened my period, helped my cramps, and helped my mood swings. However the success of the pill depends on how it reacts with your body.

No pregnancies because I lost my sex drive and became dry. I don't do any drugs nor smoke.  And I had mood swings that were insane.

I had mood swings before I got on any birth control usually right before my period and that is kind of the regular for me even with this pill. My skin is a lot clearer.

It's the best medication I have ever taken for bipolar. I have more energy, less irritable, less appetite, and increased sexual desire. However, it has some side effects (insomnia, nausea, mild constipation, and pains on my sides) which are all gradually fading away. I also take 40 mg Prozac per day. Lamictal is a wonder drug. I haven't reached the therapeutic level. I'm titrating slowly. I felt a great need to do this review to help others because other people's reviews have helped me in the past.

I've been able to drop my bipolar meds down from 4 different kinds to just Lamictal only for four months now. My experience is one for the books. Diagnosed with bipolar, I had tried so many different kinds of medications. My medicine cabinet looked like a pharmacy. Now I am down to one drug a day! That drug is Lamictal! Literally my saving grace. All the psychiatrists I saw, all the different medication combinations I had tried, only scratched the surface. My newest psychiatrist suggested this drug. I was skeptical because none of the other doctors I saw suggested it, and I didn't know it existed. This drug is a miracle. It has changed how I live, how I care for my kids, how I see the world. The best part is, I'm me again.\"], ['I had been empty, depressed doesn’t justify the way I was living my life. No matter how hard I tried, what medication I took. I couldn’t “mom”, House a MESS, relationships failing, Job on the line, alcohol being my go to. I started Lamictal about 2 months ago and haven’t had one day where I felt like I couldn’t make it through. I got a promotion, my laundry is done at all times, dishes washed, cooking dinner on the regular, I can get out of bed on Sundays which was a routine for years. Lamictal was my miracle for bipolar depression. Easy to say without it, I don’t know if I would be here. Now I WANT to be here, I want to succeed, self develop. Started reading self-help books, listening to motivational podcasts. If you feel like there is nothing that will help you, I highly recommend taking a chance on Lamictal. After all, when you have bipolar depression, what do you really have to lose?? DO IT.'], [\"Male, 33 years old. I've been on Lamictal for 4 months after being diagnosed with cyclothymia. Started with 50 mg, now 100 mg once a day. Mood swings all my life, often irritable, easily become angry. Spent money, got into debts massively, never worked at one place for more than a few months. Lucky to find the right psychiatrist who put me on Lamictal. In my country (Russia), not many doctors are familiar with bipolar spectrum disorders treatment and even fewer prescribe Lamictal. After taking the first 50 mg, everything changed immediately. I became calmer, more stable, feel much more comfortable in public places and in communication with people, more confident, more present, more relaxed. Before, I had a feeling that everyone around is constantly looking at me and even judging, couldn't talk on the phone if someone is near me. Although my highs are still a bit too high, my lows are 80% better. Surely, I'm going to continue taking Lamictal.\"], [\"I never review meds but I feel like I’m doing a disservice by not sharing. I was prescribed lamotrigine at my lowest point. I was struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and PMDD. I was facing constant intrusive thoughts about death and sadness.

I have now been taking lamotrigine for 3 months and my anxiety is much lower, my emotions are not out of control before my period, and I have more peace of mind. I don’t have any bad side effects. My biggest recommendation is to start with a low dose (50mg) and after two weeks increase to 100mg. I feel like taking more than this ups your chance of having a bad reaction. We are all different so there is no guarantee. Just know that this website is usually used if you have had a relatively bad experience so take that into consideration.\"], [\"I’ve taken this drug Lamictal for about 7 weeks now and guess what? My life has turned so positive! I am a way happier and stable human. I no longer lash out or get mad over any little thing that would trigger a manic stage.

My entire life, I felt different, as if I was experiencing the world entirely different than most everyone else—funny thing is, I actually was. After trying numerous medications for ADHD and severe depression/anxiety, I was finally given the option of Lamictal as a last resort. And let me tell you, after being on it for two months, I haven't been this happy since I was a child. To everyone suffering from BPD or Bipolar disorder, THIS STUFF WORKS! Please give it a try, and you will feel the transformation after a month or two. There IS help, and I pray that each and every one of you likeminded people get the aid you need.

She said it could take weeks, but it literally took about 5 days to notice a difference. My racing thoughts and deep depression are getting better daily. It's such a relief. I finally have some hope.

I have more energy, I sleep better, and I am able to let go of less than ideal situations instead of being consumed by them. I no longer default to self-harm and suicidal ideation, and my thoughts are much less hyperbolic and more aware/rooted in reality. I cannot remember the last time I was this stable and happy. I have not experienced any rashes or physical changes other than my appetite slightly decreasing and losing a bit of weight. 150mg is definitely the sweet spot for me, and I do not intend to increase my dose at this time. I would highly recommend this medication, especially if you are like me and have exhausted every other option.'], ['Lamictal has completely changed my life. I take it in conjunction with a low dose of Abilify, and the combination has kept me from having manic/depressive for about a year straight now, something I never thought possible. At first, I was just on Abilify—a pretty high dose—and while it kept me free from hypomania, it didn’t really do much for the depression. Lamictal, on the other hand, has worked wonders in that respect. Very little side effects—I wake up nauseous but it fades after about an hour, and it’s definitely worth it. Other than that, no weight gain, and I believe it may have actually increased my previously nonexistent sex drive. The best part of Lamictal is that I don’t feel flat or subdued. I’m still having the normal ups and downs of life, but for the first time, I feel pretty confident that they’re not bipolar related. It’s really been a miracle drug for me.'], ['Have successfully managed my bipolar since 1999 with Lamictal. On 400 mg/day for the last 10 years. The only issues sometimes I get dizzy on a step ladder (I avoid it), blurry vision late at night, feel a little flat, and increased sex drive. I went undiagnosed for 35 years. This drug has saved my life! I’ll take feeling a little flat over crying for days at a time or 5 days straight with no sleep, cooking, repainting, and redecorating 3 rooms in the house. This includes DIY furniture and window treatments and yes, spending money I didn’t have! Now I have several businesses, cash in bank, bills paid, and fairly regular sleep. Lamictal saved my life after my divorce 21 years ago.'], [\"I have struggled with anxiety off and on over the years. I tried SSRIs in the past and those never gave me much relief. I got to a point where I was in a downward spiral of anxiety (crazy thoughts, wild mood swings, uneasy digestive issues, sleep issues, etc.). I decided to give medicine another shot. My doc prescribed me lamotrigine and now I'm on 100mg. I am MUCH more stable. I don’t have the crazy intrusive thoughts as much, and my perspective on life is much more positive. It did not make me dull or cause any other negative side effects. It just gradually allowed me to be myself again and enjoy life. Please do know that medication in general can absolutely help. Do not listen to outsiders who do not understand how you feel. Medication is a personal option that you should feel no judgment about. If it helps you, then that’s all that matters! It may take a while to find the right medication for you, but it is worth it. Never give up. There is something that will help you.\"], [\"I've struggled undiagnosed with Bipolar 2 for years- many times having it labeled and treated as depression (Prozac, Wellbutrin, etc., all of which helped the depression but made me manic). The one time I was told it could be bipolar 2 at age 25, the diagnosis scared me (the idea of being on medication for the rest of my life did too) so I decided to go off of all meds and 'handle it on my own'. 7 years later, after multiple tumultuous relationships, tons of money spent on shopping, and some extreme bouts of both depression and hypomania, I finally started on this medication, Lamictal. I have been on it for about 6 weeks and am up to 100mg, and I finally know what 'normal' feels like... and it's not racing thoughts 24/7 or snapping on loved ones at the drop of a hat. Almost no side effects.\"], [\"I have taken lamotrigine for years with no side effects. It takes approximately 1.5-2 months for lamotrigine to take full effect. Side effects are typically avoided by starting at very low doses (I started at 25 mg once a day) and slowly increasing the dose over time. Taking higher doses too rapidly or without physician consultation increases risks of side effects, and you shouldn't expect to see full results within a couple days or even a couple weeks. I hope this helps someone feel less anxious about trying out this medication and feel more informed! (I am educated on this topic because I'm an MD student.)\"], ['Lamictal has changed my life! I have had medication-resistant depression for over 30 years. I am now 60. I have been on every med out there, only to keep from being suicidal at best. I was on Abilify for 3 or 4 years with Viibryd. I gained 30 lbs, and cholesterol went sky-high. So, as a last resort, I decided to try lamictal. I am on 150mg and 30mg of Viibryd. It has totally changed my life. I am no longer depressed at all! My friends and family are amazed at the difference they see in me. I am socializing with people and taking care of myself again. I think I feel better than I did before being diagnosed with depression. Now I know we all react to meds differently, but if you are having trouble finding something that works, this is worth a try. I have major depression, not bipolar. I say that because most things I read about using lamictal were to help with bipolar. But it can also help as an add-on to your antidepressant. I thank GOD I found out about it.'], [\"I've struggled with Bipolar II since I was a teenager. Unfortunately, it was misdiagnosed as depression until I was in my 60s. As you can imagine, I've been prescribed everything available, beginning first with what were called 'tricyclics,' which were medications like Mellaril (thioridazine), Elavil (amitriptyline), to the SSRIs such as Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, Celexa, and several others. I took other types of medications for depression or anxiety, too many to mention, all with varying and limited levels of success. Some were helpful for a time, others not at all. That was until I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and prescribed Lamictal. This medication, along with psychotherapy, has had a profound effect on my life. I have to say, I've never felt better.\"], [\"My whole life I was depressed. I started using drugs at age 16, which led to a 17-year battle with depression and addiction. It was like, no matter where I was, my mind would tell me I didn't belong. I've been taking this medicine for a year and a half. It is NOT a coincidence that I got sober and haven't picked up a drug since. It's not a coincidence that I'm a mom again, a friend, and a daughter. This medicine allowed me to breathe and go with the flow of life optimistically. It's mild, so it's perfect. This medicine saved my life.

Then, after research, I asked my psychiatrist for Lamictal. I had 0 side effects!! I started at a dose of 25mg for 2 weeks and am at the end of 2 weeks on 50mg. I felt the difference by the second week of 25mg and even more at 50mg. I have felt so hopeful and excited at times in perfectly healthy ways, and depression and anxiety are all but gone. I don't feel doped up at all, just a better version of me than I have ever felt. Also, unlike SSRIs, this doesn't impact sex drive, and if I get pregnant, it's safe.

      "[[\"I've tried almost all meds for depression/bipolar but no success. I started Lamictal 25mg about 4 weeks ago and I'm currently on 50mg per day. It has really lifted my depression. It's the best medication I have ever taken for bipolar. I have more energy, less irritable, less appetite, and increased sexual desire. However, it has some side effects (insomnia, nausea, mild constipation, and pains on my sides) which are all gradually fading away. I also take 40 mg Prozac per day. Lamictal is a wonder drug. I haven't reached the therapeutic level. I'm titrating slowly. I felt a great need to do this review to help others because other people's reviews have helped me in the past. Good luck and God bless.\"], [\"I have been on this drug Lamictal for a total time of 14 months. I've been able to drop my bipolar meds down from 4 different kinds to just Lamictal only for four months now. My experience is one for the books. Diagnosed with bipolar, I had tried so many different kinds of medications. My medicine cabinet looked like a pharmacy. Now I am down to one drug a day! That drug is Lamictal! Literally my saving grace. All the psychiatrists I saw, all the different medication combinations I had tried, only scratched the surface. My newest psychiatrist suggested this drug. I was skeptical because none of the other doctors I saw suggested it, and I didn't know it existed. This drug is a miracle. It has changed how I live, how I care for my kids, how I see the world. The best part is, I'm me again.\"], ['I had been empty, depressed doesn’t justify the way I was living my life. No matter how hard I tried, what medication I took. I couldn’t “mom”, House a MESS, relationships failing, Job on the line, alcohol being my go to. I started Lamictal about 2 months ago and haven’t had one day where I felt like I couldn’t make it through. I got a promotion, my laundry is done at all times, dishes washed, cooking dinner on the regular, I can get out of bed on Sundays which was a routine for years. Lamictal was my miracle for bipolar depression. Easy to say without it, I don’t know if I would be here. Now I WANT to be here, I want to succeed, self develop. Started reading self-help books, listening to motivational podcasts. If you feel like there is nothing that will help you, I highly recommend taking a chance on Lamictal. After all, when you have bipolar depression, what do you really have to lose?? DO IT.'], [\"Male, 33 years old. I've been on Lamictal for 4 months after being diagnosed with cyclothymia. Started with 50 mg, now 100 mg once a day. Mood swings all my life, often irritable, easily become angry. Spent money, got into debts massively, never worked at one place for more than a few months. Lucky to find the right psychiatrist who put me on Lamictal. In my country (Russia), not many doctors are familiar with bipolar spectrum disorders treatment and even fewer prescribe Lamictal. After taking the first 50 mg, everything changed immediately. I became calmer, more stable, feel much more comfortable in public places and in communication with people, more confident, more present, more relaxed. Before, I had a feeling that everyone around is constantly looking at me and even judging, couldn't talk on the phone if someone is near me. Although my highs are still a bit too high, my lows are 80% better. Surely, I'm going to continue taking Lamictal.\"], [\"I never review meds but I feel like I’m doing a disservice by not sharing. I was prescribed lamotrigine at my lowest point. I was struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and PMDD. I was facing constant intrusive thoughts about death and sadness. I came home from the doctor's after being prescribed and read these reviews and bawled my eyes out. I was so afraid of taking this medication. Yet, I needed something to help ASAP. I have now been taking lamotrigine for 3 months and my anxiety is much lower, my emotions are not out of control before my period, and I have more peace of mind. I don’t have any bad side effects. My biggest recommendation is to start with a low dose (50mg) and after two weeks increase to 100mg. I feel like taking more than this ups your chance of having a bad reaction. We are all different so there is no guarantee. Just know that this website is usually used if you have had a relatively bad experience so take that into consideration.\"], [\"I’ve taken this drug Lamictal for about 7 weeks now and guess what? My life has turned so positive! I am a way happier and stable human. I no longer lash out or get mad over any little thing that would trigger a manic stage. I’ve been able to deal with stress without freaking out, literally can't believe it! I highly recommend this to anyone with bipolar!!!! Good luck and God bless\"], [\"I am a person that never writes reviews, however, if I can help just one person from feeling the way I used to feel—it's beyond worth it. My entire life, I felt different, as if I was experiencing the world entirely different than most everyone else—funny thing is, I actually was. After trying numerous medications for ADHD and severe depression/anxiety, I was finally given the option of Lamictal as a last resort. And let me tell you, after being on it for two months, I haven't been this happy since I was a child. To everyone suffering from BPD or Bipolar disorder, THIS STUFF WORKS! Please give it a try, and you will feel the transformation after a month or two. There IS help, and I pray that each and every one of you likeminded people get the aid you need.

She said it could take weeks, but it literally took about 5 days to notice a difference. My racing thoughts and deep depression are getting better daily. It's such a relief. I finally have some hope.

This medicine is 50:50\"], [\"Paracetamol The only thing that works for me without any side effects, takes about 20 minutes to kick in, fantastic for muscle pain and anxiety attacks and insomnia, I take two 500mg tablets every 4 hours (four times a day), for two days then I'm okay.\"], [\"It is the ABSOLUTE WORST PAINKILLER to take when you have period pain. It does did not ease my period pain at all. I would not recommend it to anyone . DON'T TOUCH IT. I am very lucky now that I do not take Paracetamol anymore.\"], ['I have found Tylenol and other equivalents to be relatively ineffective in reducing pain associated with my Degenerative Disk Disease (Neck Pain, Severe Headaches, Lower Back Pain).  I have had some success with tramadol coupled with muscle relaxants, Tylenol with codeine and Vicodin (5 and 7.5 mg).

I think the effect of rapid administration IV should be hammered on.'], ['Paracetamol is a very fine medicine.'], ['paracetamol is the best and safe drug. its really amazing'], [\"It's for fever and muscle pain.
